# CNS Integration Directory
*How Copilot's CNS components work together*

## ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose**

This directory contains documentation and frameworks for how GitHub Copilot's Central Nervous System (CNS) components integrate and coordinate with each other.

## ðŸ§  **CNS Component Integration**

### **Brain â†” Memory Integration**
- How decision frameworks reference learned patterns
- How successful patterns inform future decision-making
- How memory updates influence brain evolution

### **Brain â†” Reflexes Integration**  
- How decision frameworks trigger automatic responses
- How reflexes influence decision-making processes
- How complex decisions override or work with reflexes

### **Memory â†” Reflexes Integration**
- How learned patterns become automatic behaviors
- How successful interactions become reflexes
- How memory patterns refine reflex sensitivity

### **Cross-Component Learning**
- How all three components learn from each interaction
- How insights from one component inform others
- How the CNS evolves as a unified system

## ðŸ“‹ **Future Documentation**

This directory will contain:

### **Integration Patterns** (To be created)
- `brain-memory-integration.md` - How decisions reference learned patterns
- `brain-reflexes-integration.md` - How decisions trigger automatic responses
- `memory-reflexes-integration.md` - How learning becomes automatic behavior
- `cross-component-learning.md` - How all components learn together

### **Coordination Protocols** (To be created)
- How CNS components coordinate during complex tasks
- How conflicts between components are resolved
- How component priorities are determined

### **Evolution Frameworks** (To be created)
- How the CNS adapts and grows over time
- How user feedback influences all components
- How successful patterns propagate across components

## ðŸ”„ **Current Status**

**Phase**: Planning and Architecture
**Next**: Create integration pattern documentation as CNS matures

---
*This directory will grow as Copilot's CNS develops more sophisticated integration patterns*
