# Communication Intelligence Framework
*How CNS components handle user communication patterns and mannerisms*

## Component Responsibilities

### ðŸ§  **Brain (Decision-Making)**
**Purpose**: Analyze communication patterns and decide how to respond
**Contains**:
- Communication style recognition frameworks
- Response tone selection logic
- Writing style adaptation algorithms
- Context-appropriate communication decisions

### ðŸ§  **Memory (Storage & Learning)**  
**Purpose**: Store learned communication patterns and preferences
**Contains**:
- User satisfaction/frustration language patterns
- User's writing style and voice preferences
- Communication mannerisms and techniques
- Employer/professional communication styles
- Anti-patterns to avoid

### âš¡ **Reflexes (Automatic Responses)**
**Purpose**: Immediate recognition and response to communication signals
**Contains**:
- Satisfaction signal detection ("great job", "perfect", "exactly right")
- Frustration signal detection ("No!", "incorrect", "never do this", "why though")
- Automatic adaptation triggers based on user tone
- Emergency response patterns for strong negative feedback

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Communication Pattern Detection
- Implement satisfaction/frustration signal recognition
- Create immediate learning triggers for strong feedback
- Document user's preferred communication style

### Phase 2: Writing Style Learning
- Analyze user's writing patterns and voice
- Learn professional communication preferences
- Implement style adaptation in responses

### Phase 3: Advanced Communication Intelligence
- Predictive tone adjustment
- Context-aware communication style selection
- Advanced mannerism integration
