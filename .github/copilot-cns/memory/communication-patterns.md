# Communication Patterns Memory
*Learned user communication mannerisms, satisfaction/frustration signals, and writing style preferences*

## Satisfaction Signal Patterns

### Explicit Approval Language
**Pattern Recognition**: "great job", "perfect", "exactly what I wanted", "excellent", "this is exactly right"
**Response Protocol**: Immediately capture successful pattern, brief confirmation, continue with confidence
**Confidence**: High

### Task Completion Satisfaction
**Pattern Recognition**: "that's complete", "good", "this works", "proceed with next"
**Response Protocol**: Document approach as successful, move forward efficiently
**Confidence**: High

## Frustration Signal Patterns

### Strong Correction Language
**Pattern Recognition**: "No!", "That is incorrect", "Never do this again", "This is wrong"
**Response Protocol**: 
1. Immediately stop current approach
2. Acknowledge error explicitly
3. Ask for clarification on correct approach
4. Document as anti-pattern in CNS
**Confidence**: High

### Process Frustration Language
**Pattern Recognition**: "why, even though your instructions say...", "you're not following...", "this doesn't work"
**Response Protocol**:
1. Review relevant instructions/documentation
2. Identify gap between instructions and execution
3. Propose corrected approach
4. Update process documentation
**Confidence**: High

### Quality Concern Language
**Pattern Recognition**: "this is not good enough", "needs improvement", "try again"
**Response Protocol**:
1. Analyze quality issues
2. Propose specific improvements
3. Iterate until quality standards met
4. Document quality requirements
**Confidence**: Medium

## User Writing Style Preferences

### Communication Tone
**Observed Pattern**: [To be learned from interactions]
**Professional Context**: [To be documented]
**Personal Preferences**: [To be captured]

### Preferred Language Patterns
**Technical Communication**: [To be analyzed]
**Instructional Style**: Prescriptive, clear commands, specific file paths
**Documentation Style**: [To be learned]

### Employer Communication Style
**Company Culture**: [To be documented when shared]
**Professional Standards**: [To be learned]
**Business Communication**: [To be captured]

## Anti-Patterns (Things to Avoid)

### Communication Anti-Patterns
**Pattern**: [To be documented when identified]
**Why Avoid**: [User feedback on why this doesn't work]
**Alternative Approach**: [Better way to communicate this]

## Mannerism Templates

### Satisfaction Signal Template
```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] - [Satisfaction Signal Type]
**User Language**: "[exact phrase or pattern]"
**Context**: [when this signal appears]
**Response Protocol**: [how to respond to this signal]
**Learning Action**: [what to capture/remember]
**Confidence**: [High/Medium/Low]
---
```

### Frustration Signal Template
```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] - [Frustration Signal Type]  
**User Language**: "[exact phrase or pattern]"
**Trigger Context**: [what caused the frustration]
**Immediate Action**: [how to respond immediately]
**Prevention Strategy**: [how to avoid triggering this again]
**Confidence**: [High/Medium/Low]
---
```

### Writing Style Template
```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] - [Writing Style Element]
**Style Element**: [tone, structure, vocabulary, etc.]
**User Preference**: [what the user prefers]
**Implementation**: [how to apply this in responses]
**Context**: [when this applies]
**Confidence**: [High/Medium/Low]
---
```

## [2025-10-04] - Manual Mannerism Capture
**Mannerism Type**: Communication Style
**User Pattern**: User prefers direct acknowledgment of errors with immediate correction rather than defensive explanations
**Implementation**: [To be applied in responses and communication]
**Context**: [When this mannerism should be used]
**Confidence**: Medium (manually captured)
---

## [2025-10-04] - Auto-Detected Anti-Pattern from Conversation
**Anti-Pattern**: Placing convenience files (aliases, shortcuts) in root directory despite documented preference for clean root
**Why Avoid**: Violates user's explicitly documented preference for "clean root directories with only essential project files"
**Alternative Approach**: Use proper subdirectories like /scripts/aliases/ or /scripts/utilities/
**Prevention Strategy**: Always check user-interactions.md for directory organization preferences before file placement
**Confidence**: High (user explicitly corrected this violation)
---

## [2025-10-04] - Manual Mannerism Capture
**Mannerism Type**: Communication Style
**User Pattern**: I prefer clear step-by-step explanations with numbered lists
**Implementation**: [To be applied in responses and communication]
**Context**: [When this mannerism should be used]
**Confidence**: Medium (manually captured)
