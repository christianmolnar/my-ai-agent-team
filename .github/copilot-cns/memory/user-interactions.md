# User Interactions Memory
*This file will be populated as Copilot learns user preferences*

## [2025-10-04] - Documentation Organization Preferences
**User Preference**: Prefers single source of truth for documentation, dislikes confusion between multiple doc locations
**Implementation**: Always consolidate documentation into one well-organized location (AI-Agent-Team-Document-Library)
**Scope**: All documentation decisions and file organization
**Confidence**: High
---

## [2025-10-04] - File Naming and Purpose Clarity  
**User Preference**: Demands accurate file names that reflect actual purpose (not misleading names like "status-updates" for methodology)
**Implementation**: Ensure file names clearly indicate content and purpose; rename when purpose evolves
**Scope**: All file naming decisions, especially for frameworks and documentation
**Confidence**: High
---

## [2025-10-04] - Root Directory Organization
**User Preference**: Strong preference for clean root directories with only essential project files
**Implementation**: Move all non-essential files to proper subdirectories; maintain professional structure
**Scope**: Repository organization and file placement decisions
**Confidence**: High
---

## [2025-10-04] - Prescriptive vs Descriptive Instructions
**User Preference**: Wants prescriptive "do this" instructions rather than descriptive "you could do this" guidance
**Implementation**: Provide clear, executable commands and step-by-step instructions with specific file names and paths
**Scope**: All setup guides, documentation, and user-facing instructions
**Confidence**: High
---

## [2025-10-04] - Verification and Testing Preferences
**User Preference**: Values verification of claims and actual testing of functionality rather than assumptions
**Implementation**: Always verify file existence, test scripts, and validate claimed functionality before stating completion
**Scope**: All status reports and completion claims
**Confidence**: High
---

## [2025-10-04] - Command Interface Preferences  
**User Preference**: Demands descriptive command names over cryptic abbreviations (prefers "document preference" over "pref")
**Implementation**: Use clear, multi-word command names that describe exactly what the command does
**Scope**: All command-line interfaces, scripts, and user-facing tools
**Confidence**: High (user explicitly corrected cryptic aliases)
---

## [2025-10-04] - Communication Intelligence Requirements
**User Preference**: Expects CNS to understand satisfaction signals, frustration signals, and communication mannerisms for personalized interaction
**Implementation**: Build communication pattern recognition into CNS reflexes and memory systems
**Scope**: All user interaction analysis and response adaptation
**Confidence**: High (explicitly requested enhancement)
---

## Interaction Template
```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] - [Context]
**User Preference**: [What was learned about user preferences]
**Implementation**: [How to apply this preference]
**Scope**: [When this preference applies]
**Confidence**: [High/Medium/Low]
---
```

*This file grows as user patterns are learned*

## [2025-10-04] - Short Command Syntax Preference
**User Preference**: Short command syntax without ./scripts/ prefix for easier workflow
**Implementation**: Permanent PATH setup so users can type 'cns "command"' instead of './scripts/cns "command"'
**Scope**: All command-line interfaces and daily workflow
**Confidence**: High (explicitly requested and implemented)
---

## [2025-10-04] - Setup Simplicity Preference
**User Preference**: Simple, clean setup without overwhelming options
**Implementation**: Single automatic solution instead of multiple confusing alternatives
**Scope**: All setup processes, documentation, and user onboarding
**Confidence**: High (user expressed frustration with overwhelming options)
---

## [2025-10-04] - Natural Language Command Interface Preference
**User Preference**: Commands should use natural language interface and avoid cluttering root directory
**Implementation**: Use single entry point with descriptive subcommands in proper directory structure
**Scope**: All command-line interfaces and script organization
**Confidence**: High (user explicitly corrected root directory placement)
---

## [2025-10-04] - Duplicate Detection Implementation
**User Preference**: Duplicate detection prevents redundant learning entries
**Implementation**: Check existing memory before adding new entries to prevent accumulation of identical learnings
**Scope**: All CNS learning functions (preferences, patterns, anti-patterns)
**Confidence**: High (user explicitly requested this improvement)
