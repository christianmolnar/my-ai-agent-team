I need to understand the academic requirements, intended audience, and specific aspects of MLK's legacy to focus on.\n\n## QUESTIONS:\n\n1.What is the intended purpose and audience for this research paper (e.g., academic assignment, personal knowledge, publication)? This will help determine the appropriate tone, length, and citation style.\n2.Are there specific aspects of MLK Jr's legacy you'd like the paper to emphasize (e.g., civil rights legislation, his theological contributions, specific speeches or campaigns)?\n3.What are your requirements regarding length, format, and deadline for this research paper?\n## NEXT:\nOnce I have this information, I'll be able to coordinate between the researcher agent (to gather appropriate scholarly sources), the communications agent (to structure and draft the paper according to your needs), and the project coordinator (to ensure timely delivery). I'll provide a clear plan with milestones for developing a well-researched paper that meets your specific requirements.\n\nPlease answer these questions so I can create the best possible solution for you. Once I have this information, I'll prepare a detailed requirements document and ask for your approval before proceeding."
