## üìö **Learning System Behavior**

The system tracks:
1. **File modifications** made during learning
2. **User feedback** (internalize vs forget)
3. **Rollback capabilities** with backup system
4. **Claude analysis** for complex behavioral changes
5. **CNS updates** for cognitive and memory enhancements

This data helps the AI learn what changes are valuable to users and what should be avoided in the future.
