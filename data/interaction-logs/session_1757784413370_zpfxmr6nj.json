Your request requires a focused primer rather than an exhaustive list of tasks. However, to create the most effective onboarding guide, I need to better understand your specific situation, prior experience, and immediate priorities.\n\n## QUESTIONS:\n1. What is your prior experience with Atlassian products (Jira, Confluence, etc.), and have you received any specific information about which teams/products you'll be working with at Atlassian?\n\n2. Do you have any specific onboarding materials or access to Rovo already, or are you looking for guidance on how to request and leverage these resources once you start?\n\n3. What are your top 2-3 priorities for your first two weeks (e.g., understanding team structure, learning technical aspects of products, establishing relationships with stakeholders)?\n\n## NEXT:\nOnce I have these details, I'll create a concise, actionable guide that includes:\n- A focused \"Day 1\" and \"Week 1\" plan for effective onboarding as a TPM at Atlassian\n- Specific guidance on how to leverage Rovo for your particular situation\n- Key resources and connections to prioritize based on your role's specific needs\n- Practical tips for navigating Atlassian's culture and tools as a new TPM\n\nThis will be structured as a practical primer rather than an overwhelming list, giving you clear direction while allowing flexibility as you learn the company landscape.\n\nPlease answer these questions so I can create the best possible solution for you. Once I have this information, I'll prepare a detailed requirements document and ask for your approval before proceeding.",
