To provide a meaningful feature overview, I need to understand the specific scope, the user's role/perspective, and what level of detail would be most valuable for their needs.\n\nQUESTIONS:\n1. What specific system, platform, or product are you asking about features for? (e.g., a software application, service offering, existing system you're evaluating, or something being developed)\n\n2. What's your primary goal with this feature information - are you evaluating capabilities for a decision, planning an implementation, training users, or something else?\n\n3. Are you looking for a high-level overview of major capabilities, or do you need detailed functionality within specific areas that are most relevant to your use case?\n\nNEXT: Once I understand the specific context and your intended use of this information, I'll coordinate with the research team to compile a comprehensive, targeted feature list and capability overview that matches your needs and decision-making requirements.\n\nPlease answer these questions so I can create the best possible solution for you. Once I have this information, I'll prepare a detailed requirements document and ask for your approval before proceeding.",
