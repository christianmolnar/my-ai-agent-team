A concise onboarding guide for a new Technical Project Manager at Atlassian\n2. A quick-start guide for using Rovo as an onboarding/ramping tool\n3. Focus on practical, immediate actions rather than comprehensive information\n\n## Information Gaps\nWhile I understand the basic need, several critical details are missing:\n\n### Missing Information\n1. The user's familiarity with project management tools and Atlassian products\n2. Specific responsibilities of their Technical PM role at Atlassian\n3. Whether they have access to Rovo already or need to request it\n4. Their learning preferences and time constraints\n5. Any specific teams or products they'll be working with\n\n## Targeted Questions\n\n1. **What is your prior experience with Atlassian products (Jira, Confluence, etc.), and do you know which specific teams/products you'll be supporting in your Technical PM role?**\n\n2. **Do you already have access to Rovo, and what specific aspects of onboarding are you hoping it will help with (e.g., understanding company structure, learning about processes, connecting with team members)?**\n\n3. **What is your preferred learning style (e.g., step-by-step guides, visual references, practical exercises), and how much time can you realistically dedicate to onboarding activities in your first week?**\n\n## Next Steps\nOnce I have these answers, I will:\n1. Create a targeted, prioritized onboarding plan specific to Technical PMs at Atlassian\n2. Develop a practical Rovo quick-start guide focused on your specific needs\n3. Structure the information according to your learning preferences and time constraints\n4. Include only the most essential resources and actions to avoid overwhelming you\n5. Ensure the guide supports both immediate productivity and longer-term integration\n\nPlease answer these questions so I can create the best possible solution for you.

The user wants to quickly learn about Atlassian as a company and ramp up efficiently. While I have the basic intent and the link to Rovo features, I need more specific information about their role, team context, and learning priorities to create an effective, personalized plan.\n\nQUESTIONS:\n1. Which specific team or product area will you be joining at Atlassian, and do you know your initial project responsibilities or focus areas as a Technical PM?\n\n2. What are your top 3 priority learning areas (e.g., Atlassian's product ecosystem, internal processes, technical PM methodologies at Atlassian, specific tools beyond Jira/Confluence)?\n\n3. Do you already have access to Rovo, and have you been assigned any specific onboarding activities or contacts (mentor, manager) who will guide your initial weeks?\n\nNEXT:\nOnce I have these details, I'll create a comprehensive requirements document for your onboarding solution that includes:\n1. A structured Rovo-based onboarding plan tailored to your specific team and Technical PM role\n2. A prioritized learning path focusing on your identified priority areas\n3. A quick-start guide for using Rovo effectively for onboarding\n4. Key resources and connections specific to your role and team context\n5.
