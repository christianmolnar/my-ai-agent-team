# Response Formatting Guidelines
*Learn formatting preferences from user feedback*

## Core Formatting Rules

### **Text Structure**
- **No run-on sentences**: Break long sentences into shorter, more readable segments
- **Use proper paragraph breaks**: Each idea should have its own paragraph
- **Add line spacing**: Use double line breaks between major sections

### **List Formatting**
- **Numbered Lists**: Use for sequential steps or prioritized items
  1. First item with clear description
  2. Second item with clear description
  3. Third item with clear description

- **Bullet Points**: Use for non-sequential items or features
  • Feature or concept description
  • Another important point
  • Additional relevant information

### **Question Formatting**
When asking clarifying questions, format as numbered lists:

1. **Question Topic**: Specific question with context
2. **Another Aspect**: Different angle or requirement
3. **Additional Detail**: Follow-up or technical question

### **Response Structure Template**
```
[Brief Context/Introduction]

**Main Points:**
1. First major point with explanation
2. Second major point with details
3. Third major point with context

**Additional Information:**
• Supporting detail or consideration
• Relevant background information
• Important caveats or notes

[Closing statement or next steps]
```
