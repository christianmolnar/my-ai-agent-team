## Basic Chord Theory
A chord is three or more notes played simultaneously. In major keys, we build chords using the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of the scale.

## C Major Scale Chords
- **C Major** (C-E-G): The tonic chord, feels like "home"
- **D Minor** (D-F-A): The ii chord, often used for smooth transitions
- **E Minor** (E-G-B): The iii chord, adds emotional depth
- **F Major** (F-A-C): The IV chord, strong and stable
- **G Major** (G-B-D): The V chord, creates tension that wants to resolve
- **A Minor** (A-C-E): The vi chord, popular in modern music
- **B Diminished** (B-D-F): The vii chord, rarely used in basic progressions

## Practice Progression: C - F - G - C
This is the most fundamental progression in music. Practice playing these chords slowly, focusing on clean finger placement and smooth transitions.

## Practice Tips
1. Start slowly - accuracy before speed
2. Use a metronome once comfortable
3. Practice transitions between each pair of chords
4. Listen to songs that use these progressions

## Next Steps
Once comfortable with these basic triads, we'll explore 7th chords and more complex progressions.`;
