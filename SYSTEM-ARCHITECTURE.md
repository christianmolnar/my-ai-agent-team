# AI Agent Team - System Architecture Overview

## Repository Structure

### Private Repository: `/my-personal-assistant-private/ai-team/`
Contains the **Central Nervous System (CNS)** for all 20 agents:

```

### Public Repository: `/My-AI-Agent-Team/app/`
Contains the **connective tissue** - web interfaces and APIs:

```

## Agent Team Structure

### Core Team (Priority 1)
1. **Master Orchestrator** - Central coordination hub
2. **Personal Assistant Agent** - Executive stakeholder interface  
3. **Project Coordinator** - Timeline and resource management
4. **Music Coach** - Specialized music education

### Supporting Team (Priority 2) 
5. **Communications Agent** - Content creation
6. **Researcher Agent** - Data gathering and analysis
7. **Experience Designer** - UX and visual design
8. **Personal Assistant Bridge** - API security and management

### Specialized Team (Priority 3)
9-20. Developer agents, security experts, monitoring specialists, etc.

## CNS Architecture

Each agent has a **Central Nervous System** with four components:

### 🧠 Brain (`/cns/brain/`)
Strategic intelligence and decision-making capabilities
- Cognitive frameworks
- Executive alignment
- Learning parameters

### 🗃️ Memory (`/cns/memory/`)  
Knowledge storage and learning repository
- Domain expertise
- Executive preferences
- Collaboration patterns
- Performance history

### ⚡ Reflexes (`/cns/reflexes/`)
Instant response patterns and adaptive behaviors
- Emergency protocols
- Quick response triggers
- Adaptive management patterns

### 🔗 Integration (`/cns/integration/`)
Multi-agent coordination and system integration
- Communication protocols
- Workflow coordination
- Quality assurance processes

## Workflow Example: New Orleans Piano Masterclass

1. **Executive Request** → Personal Assistant Agent
2. **Project Analysis** → Master Orchestrator
3. **Agent Assignment** → Project Coordinator
4. **Content Creation** → Music Coach + Supporting Agents
5. **Quality Review** → Master Orchestrator
6. **Delivery** → Personal Assistant → Executive Stakeholder

## Security Architecture

- **Private Repository**: Contains all CNS data and API credentials
- **Personal Assistant Bridge**: Secure API gateway with rate limiting
- **Public Repository**: Contains only interface code, no secrets
- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data in private `.env.local`

## Next Steps

1. **Test Core 4-Agent Workflow** - New Orleans Piano scenario
2. **Implement Real CNS Communication** - Connect public interfaces to private CNS
3. **Add Remaining 16 Agents** - Complete the specialized team
4. **Scale Testing** - Multiple concurrent projects
5. **Performance Optimization** - System efficiency improvements

## Current Status

✅ **Private Repository**: Complete CNS infrastructure for all 20 agents  
✅ **Public Repository**: Web interfaces and API endpoints created  
✅ **Core Team**: 4 priority agents fully structured  
✅ **Supporting Infrastructure**: Agent dashboard, orchestrator interface, music coach page  
⏳ **Next**: Connect public interfaces to private CNS system for live coordination
