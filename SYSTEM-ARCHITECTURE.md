#### **Advanced Removal Strategies**
```typescript
interface RemovalStrategies {
  surgical_removal: 'Precisely remove specific patterns without affecting related behaviors';
  deprecation_replacement: 'Mark as deprecated and provide replacement behavior';
  conditional_removal: 'Remove behavior only in specific contexts';
  gradual_removal: 'Phase out behavior over multiple interactions';
  conflict_resolution: 'Address behavioral conflicts before removal';
  backup_restore: 'Safe removal with automatic rollback capability';
}
```

#### **Conflict Detection Engine**
```typescript
interface ConflictAnalysis {
  directConflicts: string[];      // Behaviors explicitly depending on target
  indirectConflicts: string[];    // Workflow patterns that might break
  functionalGaps: string[];       // Areas where no behavior would exist after removal
  riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  resolutionStrategy: 'safe_removal' | 'conflict_resolution' | 'replacement_required';
}
```

### **Technical Implementation**

#### **1. Enhanced Global Learning System**
```typescript
class EnhancedGlobalLearningSystem {
  async teachNewBehavior(description: string): Promise<LearningResult>;
  async removeBehavior(description: string): Promise<RemovalResult>;
  async analyzeBehaviorForCNS(description: string): Promise<BehaviorAnalysis>;
  async detectBehaviorConflicts(analysis: any, currentCNS: any): Promise<ConflictAnalysis>;
  async createCNSBackup(agent: string): Promise<string>;
  async restoreCNSBackup(agent: string, backupId: string): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

#### **2. Personal Assistant Bridge Enhancement**
```typescript
class PersonalAssistantBridge {
  // New behavior removal methods
  async removeBehavior(payload: any): Promise<AgentTaskResult>;
  async analyzeCNSState(payload: any): Promise<AgentTaskResult>;
  async createCNSBackup(payload: any): Promise<AgentTaskResult>;
  async restoreCNSBackup(payload: any): Promise<AgentTaskResult>;
}
```

#### **3. API Enhancement**
```typescript
POST /api/personal-assistant/methodology
Body: { 
  area: string,
  improvement: string,
  action?: 'learn' | 'remove'  // Auto-detected or explicit
}

// Enhanced response includes removal capabilities
{
  success: boolean,
  action: 'learn' | 'remove',
  removedBehaviors?: string[],
  conflictsDetected?: string[],
  filesModified?: string[],
  removalReport?: RemovalFeedbackReport,
  learningReport?: LearningFeedbackReport,
  backupId?: string
}
```
