# AI Agent Team Migration Plan - Execution Strategy
*Clean, focused migration execution with clear phases and action items*

## üéØ **Migration Objective**

**Primary Goal**: Create a clean, scalable AI Agent Team framework that can be cloned and used by others, with proper separation between public agent infrastructure and private personal data.

**Key Principles**:
- **UI Preservation**: No design changes - all pages moved with functionality intact
- **Clean Separation**: Public agents in shareable repository, private data in secure repository
- **Clonability**: Setup scripts and instructions for others to replicate
- **Security**: Secure bridge pattern for public-private data integration
