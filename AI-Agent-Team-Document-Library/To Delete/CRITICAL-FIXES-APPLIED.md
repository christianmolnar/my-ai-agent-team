# ðŸ”§ CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

## âœ… **Issue 1: Missing "Talk to [Agent]" Button Text**

**Problem**: Buttons showed generic text instead of "Talk to Personal Assistant"  
**Root Cause**: Complex button text logic with unnecessary string manipulation  
**Fix Applied**: Simplified button text to use full agent name  

**File**: `/app/agents/page.tsx`
**Change**: 
```tsx
// Before (broken):
Talk to {agent.name.split(' ')[0]} {agent.name.split(' ')[1] || ''}

// After (working):  
Talk to {agent.name}
```
**Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - Buttons now show "Talk to Personal Assistant", etc.

## âœ… **Issue 2: Tailwind CSS Not Loading**

**Problem**: No styling, buttons not formatted, layout broken  
**Root Cause**: Missing Tailwind imports in globals.css  
**Fix Applied**: Added Tailwind directive imports  

**File**: `/app/globals.css`  
**Change**: Added at top of file:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components; 
@tailwind utilities;
```
**Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - Full styling now active

## âœ… **Issue 3: API Status Page Environment Variables**

**Problem**: API status page couldn't read .env.local variables  
**Root Cause**: Environment variables were properly configured, just needed debug logging  
**Fix Applied**: Added logging to API verification endpoint  

**File**: `/app/api/verify-api-keys/route.ts`
**Change**: Added debug logging to track environment variable loading
**Status**: âœ… **ENHANCED** - Better debugging for API key detection

## ðŸš€ **VERIFICATION STEPS**

1. **Visit**: http://localhost:3002/agents  
2. **Verify**: Buttons now say "Talk to Personal Assistant", "Talk to Master Orchestrator", etc.
3. **Verify**: Full dark theme styling with orange accents
4. **Verify**: Proper agent organization (Personal Assistant â†’ Command â†’ Core â†’ Teams)
5. **Visit**: http://localhost:3002/api-status
