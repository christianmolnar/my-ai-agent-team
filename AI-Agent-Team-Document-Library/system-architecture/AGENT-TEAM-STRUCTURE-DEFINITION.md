## ðŸ”„ **Agent Collaboration Framework**

### **Review and Feedback Process**
- **The Orchestrator and Project Coordinator** will ensure each agent submits their work product to all applicable agents for review, at least for one cycle, but until all comments by other agents are addressed
- **Agents, after having taken feedback from agents and discussed pros and cons of all feedback** are empowered to make the final decision once all feedback has been given
- **We do not want a situation where agents get into endless loops** but we also do not want agent input to be taken lightly by other agents

### **Code Review Requirements**
- **Code Reviews must be performed by ALL technical agents**: from back end and front end software developers to all the test, monitoring, availability, performance, security, and privacy specialists
- **Multi-stage review process** ensuring comprehensive coverage
- **Feedback integration and conflict resolution**
