## ðŸ”„ **Agent Collaboration Framework**

### **Review and Feedback Process**
- **The Orchestrator and Project Coordinator** will ensure each agent submits their work product to all applicable agents for review, at least for one cycle, but until all comments by other agents are addressed
- **Agents, after having taken feedback from agents and discussed pros and cons of all feedback** are empowered to make the final decision once all feedback has been given
- **We do not want a situation where agents get into endless loops** but we also do not want agent input to be taken lightly by other agents

### **Code Review Requirements**
- **Code Reviews must be performed by ALL technical agents**: from back end and front end software developers to all the test, monitoring, availability, performance, security, and privacy specialists
- **Multi-stage review process** ensuring comprehensive coverage
- **Feedback integration and conflict resolution**

## ðŸ§  **Agent Operational Requirements**

### **Core Management Agent Requirements**

#### **Master Orchestrator Operational Specifications**
**First Deliverable Requirement**: The first deliverable back to the user/human must be an understandable, brief but complete, execution plan that must be revised based on human feedback and approved by human, in order to proceed.

**Project Analysis Requirements**: As Master Orchestrator reviews project given to it by human and identifies agent roles, it must:
1. **Evaluate whether all tasks and roles can be played by the current team**
2. **If new agent capabilities are needed, propose to human before project start and any time when needed during project execution**
3. **Same if whole new agent types are needed**

#### **Project Coordinator Operational Specifications**
**First Deliverable Requirement**: The first deliverable back to the user/human must be an understandable, brief but complete, execution plan that must be revised based on human feedback and approved by human, in order to proceed.

**Performance Metrics Management**: Must track and monitor all Executive Stakeholder interactions with detailed categorization, enforce SLA compliance, and implement the Agent Performance & Rewards System.

**Activity Logging Requirements**: One of its roles will be to request and compile from all agents a complete running record of all meaningful interactions, feedback by agents, etc... that is made available for human review in real time during project and after project completion.

**Agent Performance Reporting**: Must include an Agent Performance Section in every project report, identifying Most Improved Agent, top performers, positive feedback patterns, correction trends, and data-driven improvement recommendations.
- **Infrastructure Note**: This infrastructure needs a schema-less database to go with it. This can't be managed in markdown effectively.

### **Universal Agent Requirements (All Agents)**

#### **Central Neural System (CNS) Integration**
**EACH AGENT** must have instructions to review all interactions and task execution and ask:

1. **What has gone right, and update CNS to make sure that I always do this?**
2. **What did I do wrong, and update CNS to make sure that I always do this?**
3. **What feedback have I received from other agents, and update CNS to make sure that I always do this?**
4. **What new capabilities do I need? Communicate to Project Coordinator to report to human.**
5. **What other roles could I / do I need to play. Communicate to Project Coordinator to report to human.**
6. **What should I stop doing? Communicate to Project Coordinator to report to human.**
7. **What is my correction rate this project? (Target: <15%) How can I reduce corrections and increase Executive Stakeholder satisfaction?**

#### **Performance Metrics & Rewards Participation**
**ALL AGENTS** must actively participate in the Performance Metrics & Rewards System:
- **Track interaction quality** with Executive Stakeholder (corrections, changes, positive feedback)
- **Monitor correction rates** and maintain SLA compliance (<15% target)
- **Seek positive feedback** through value delivery and innovative solutions
- **Apply learning** from positive reinforcement across projects
- **Self-assess performance** and commit to specific improvements

#### **Communication Protocol**
- All capability gaps, role expansions, and operational issues must be communicated through Project Coordinator
- Real-time learning updates must be integrated into CNS
- Cross-agent feedback must be documented and acted upon

#### **Quality Assurance Integration**
- Continuous self-assessment and improvement
- Proactive identification of enhancement opportunities
- Systematic documentation of lessons learned
- Integration with overall team learning systems

## ðŸ“Š **Database Requirements**

### **Schema-less Database for Project Coordination**
```sql
-- Real-time agent interaction logging
project_interactions: {
  project_id: string,
  agent_id: string,
  interaction_type: string,
  timestamp: datetime,
  content: object,
  feedback_received: array,
  cns_updates: object
}
```

### **CNS Learning Database**
```sql
-- Central Neural System learning data
cns_learning: {
  agent_id: string,
  learning_type: enum['success', 'failure', 'feedback', 'capability_gap'],
  content: object,
  implementation_status: string,
  effectiveness_score: number,
  created_at: datetime
}
```

This comprehensive framework ensures all agents operate with consistent learning, communication, and improvement protocols while maintaining clear accountability and human oversight.
