# Agent Workflow Architecture
*Complete workflow specification for agent task processing through incoming/outgoing/working folders*

## 🔄 **Workflow Architecture Overview**

The Agent Workflow Architecture defines how all 20 agents process tasks through their standardized folder structure, coordinated by the Personal Assistant Bridge, ensuring efficient task execution and seamless collaboration.

### **Core Workflow Principles**
- **Standardized Structure**: All agents use identical folder organization
- **Bridge Orchestration**: Personal Assistant Bridge coordinates all workflow
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Agents work independently while maintaining coordination
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all task processing steps
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in quality checks and validation at each stage
