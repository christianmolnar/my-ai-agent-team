# Central Nervous System (CNS) Architecture
*Complete brain structure specification for all 20 agents with workflow integration*

## 🧠 **CNS Architecture Overview**

The Central Nervous System (CNS) provides the cognitive architecture that makes each agent intelligent, adaptive, and capable of continuous learning. Each agent has a complete CNS structure integrated with their private repository workflow folders.

### **CNS Core Components**
- **Brain**: Core identity, capabilities, and decision-making logic
- **Memory**: Learning data storage (episodic, semantic, procedural)
- **Reflexes**: Automatic responses and workflow patterns
- **Integration Layer**: Connection to private repository and Bridge interface
