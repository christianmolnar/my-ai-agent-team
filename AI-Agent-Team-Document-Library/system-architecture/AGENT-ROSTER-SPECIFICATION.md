# AI Agent Team Complete Specification
*Comprehensive definition of all 21 agents with capabilities, APIs, and integration requirements*

---

> **Central Neural System (CNS) Model**
> 
> Each agent has its own CNS‚Äîits own nervous system, personality, memories, reflexes, and learning protocols. The CNS is not a global system, but a per-agent structure that evolves as the agent operates. All references to CNS in this document refer to the agent-specific CNS, not a shared or global system.

##### **Layer 3: Private Repository Data Access**
```typescript
interface PrivateRepositoryStructure {
  identity: {
    aboutMe: PersonalContext;
    communicationsAgent: CommunicationPreferences;
    researcherAgent: ResearchPreferences;
    projectCoordinator: ProjectManagementStyle;
    shared: SharedIdentityData;
  };
  businessOperations: {
    strategicGoals: BusinessObjectives;
    financialData: FinancialContext;
    professionalDevelopment: CareerContext;
  };
  teamData: {
    people: TeamMemberProfiles;
    relationships: RelationshipContext;
    communicationHistory: InteractionHistory;
  };
}
```

### **Data Flow Patterns**

#### **Pattern 1: Identity Data Access**
1. **Agent Request**: Communications Agent needs writing style preferences
2. **Bridge Validation**: Personal Assistant Bridge validates request and agent identity
3. **Data Retrieval**: Bridge accesses `identity/communications-agent/tone-and-style-guide.md`
4. **Data Processing**: Bridge applies privacy filtering and access controls
5. **Secure Response**: Filtered data returned with audit logging
6. **Agent Action**: Communications Agent applies style preferences to content creation

#### **Pattern 2: Business Context Integration**
1. **Agent Request**: Product Manager needs strategic business context for feature prioritization
2. **Bridge Validation**: Request validated against business context access permissions
3. **Data Aggregation**: Bridge compiles relevant data from `businessOperations/strategicGoals`
4. **Context Enhancement**: Bridge enriches data with relevant team and relationship context
5. **Secure Response**: Business context provided with appropriate abstraction level
6. **Agent Action**: Product Manager incorporates business context into product decisions

#### **Pattern 3: Cross-Agent Data Sharing**
1. **Initiating Agent**: Research Agent discovers relevant information during research
2. **Bridge Notification**: Personal Assistant Bridge notified of potential cross-agent value
3. **Access Evaluation**: Bridge evaluates which other agents would benefit from information
4. **Controlled Distribution**: Bridge securely shares information with relevant agents
5. **Usage Tracking**: All agent usage of shared information logged and monitored
6. **Feedback Loop**: Agent effectiveness with shared information tracked for optimization

### **Security and Privacy Controls**

#### **Authentication and Authorization**
- **Agent Identity Verification**: Each agent has unique cryptographic identity
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Agents can only access data appropriate to their function
- **Time-Limited Access Tokens**: All access tokens expire and require renewal
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Sensitive operations require additional verification

#### **Data Classification and Handling**
- **Automatic Classification**: All private data automatically classified by sensitivity
- **Need-to-Know Access**: Agents only receive minimum necessary information
- **Data Anonymization**: Personal identifiers removed or replaced where possible
- **Retention Controls**: Automatic expiration and cleanup of agent-accessed private data

#### **Audit and Compliance**
- **Complete Access Logging**: Every private data access logged with full context
- **Audit Trail Integrity**: Logs cryptographically signed and tamper-evident
- **Compliance Reporting**: Regular reports on data access patterns and compliance
- **Incident Response**: Automated detection and response to unusual access patterns

### **Environment Configuration**

#### **Public Repository Configuration**
```bash
# Public agent environment variables
PRIVATE_BRIDGE_API_URL=https://localhost:3001/api/private-bridge
PRIVATE_BRIDGE_API_KEY=<encrypted-key>
AUDIT_LOGGING_ENABLED=true
DATA_RETENTION_HOURS=24
PRIVACY_LEVEL=high
```

#### **Private Repository Configuration**
```bash
# Private repository bridge configuration
BRIDGE_PORT=3001
PUBLIC_REPO_ALLOWED_AGENTS=agent1,agent2,agent3...
DATA_CLASSIFICATION_ENABLED=true
AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=90
PRIVACY_GUARDIAN_ENABLED=true
```

#### **VS Code Workspace Configuration**
```json
{
  "folders": [
    {
      "name": "AI Agent Team (Public)",
      "path": "/Users/christian/Repos/My-AI-Agent-Team"
    },
    {
      "name": "Personal Assistant (Private)",
      "path": "/Users/christian/Repos/my-personal-assistant-private"
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "files.exclude": {
      "**/node_modules": true,
      "**/.env*": true,
      "**/private-data/**": true
    }
  }
}
```
