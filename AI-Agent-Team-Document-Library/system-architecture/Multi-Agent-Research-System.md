# Multi-Agent Research System Architecture

## Overview
This document consolidates research and implementation strategies for building multi-agent systems, based on Anthropic's research system architecture and adapted for the AI Agent Team.

## Anthropic's Multi-Agent Research System

### Key Benefits
- **Parallelization**: Subagents explore different aspects of a problem simultaneously, increasing coverage and efficiency
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each subagent uses specialized tools, prompts, and strategies, reducing path dependency
- **Scalability**: Multi-agent systems scale performance by distributing work across agents with separate context windows
- **Emergent Collaboration**: Agents discover and synthesize insights that would be missed by sequential workflows

### Architecture Patterns
- **Orchestrator-Worker Pattern**: Lead agent analyzes queries, develops plans, and spawns subagents for parallel execution
- **Iterative Research Loop**: Lead agent refines plans, creates new subagents as needed, and synthesizes findings
- **Citation Agent**: Specialized agent processes results to ensure proper source attribution
- **Memory Management**: Agents persist plans and context to handle long conversations and context limits
- **Artifact System**: Subagents output results to shared storage, reducing information loss

### Prompt Engineering Principles
1. **Think Like Your Agents**: Simulate agent behavior to identify and fix failure modes
2. **Explicit Delegation**: Orchestrator must clearly define subagent objectives, output formats, and boundaries
3. **Effort Scaling**: Guide agents to scale effort to query complexity
4. **Tool Selection**: Provide clear heuristics for choosing appropriate tools
5. **Self-Improvement**: Use agents to refine prompts and tool descriptions
6. **Wide-then-Narrow Search**: Start broad, then focus progressively
7. **Guided Thinking**: Use extended thinking modes for planning and evaluation
8. **Parallel Tool Calls**: Enable multiple tool usage for speed and coverage

## Implementation Strategy for AI Agent Team

### Phase 1: Core Multi-Agent Framework
- Implement orchestrator-worker pattern in existing agent structure
- Add agent spawning capabilities to Master Orchestrator Agent
- Create shared memory and artifact systems
- Establish inter-agent communication protocols

### Phase 2: Specialized Research Agents
- Enhance Researcher Agent with multi-agent capabilities
- Create specialized sub-agents for different research domains
- Implement parallel search and synthesis capabilities
- Add citation and attribution systems

### Phase 3: Advanced Coordination
- Implement dynamic agent creation based on task complexity
- Add agent evaluation and quality control systems
- Create feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Establish monitoring and observability systems

### Phase 4: Production Optimization
- Optimize token usage and cost management
- Implement error handling and recovery systems
- Add performance monitoring and scaling
- Create deployment and update strategies

## Integration with Current Agent Structure

### Enhanced Agent Roles
- **Master Orchestrator Agent**: Upgraded to support multi-agent coordination
- **Researcher Agent**: Enhanced with parallel research capabilities
- **Project Coordinator Agent**: Integration with multi-agent planning
- **Communications Agent**: Synthesis and reporting of multi-agent outputs

### Tool Integration
- Leverage existing API integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI)
- Extend current tool ecosystem with multi-agent coordination
- Implement shared tool access and resource management
- Add specialized tools for agent communication

### Memory and State Management
- Extend current agent memory systems for multi-agent contexts
- Implement shared context and artifact storage
- Add checkpoint and recovery capabilities
- Create inter-agent knowledge sharing systems

## Performance Considerations

### Token Management
- Multi-agent systems use approximately 15x more tokens than single agents
- Implement intelligent token budgeting and allocation
- Use model tiers appropriately (Claude Sonnet 4 for subagents, Opus 4 for orchestration)
- Monitor and optimize token usage patterns

### Parallelization Benefits
- Research tasks can achieve 90%+ time reduction with parallel agents
- Complex queries benefit most from multi-agent approaches
- Balance parallelization with coordination overhead
- Optimize for tasks that naturally decompose into independent subtasks

## Next Steps

1. **Architecture Review**: Evaluate current agent structure for multi-agent readiness
2. **Prototype Development**: Build MVP multi-agent orchestration system
3. **Tool Enhancement**: Upgrade existing tools for multi-agent coordination
4. **Testing Framework**: Develop evaluation and testing systems
5. **Production Planning**: Prepare deployment and scaling strategies
