# AI Agent Team Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive migration plan for transferring all AI agent functionality from the f.insight.AI Advanced system to the new My-AI-Agent-Team framework.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Barebones Site Transfer âœ… COMPLETED
**Objective**: Get the basic site structure operational
- [x] Transfer core Next.js application files
- [x] Set up basic routing and page structure
- [x] Ensure site builds and runs locally
- [x] Basic styling and layout implementation

### Phase 2: Agent File Transfer âœ… COMPLETED
**Objective**: Move all agent-related files to new structure
- [x] Transfer all agent TypeScript files from f.insight.AI Advanced
- [x] Move agent configuration files
- [x] Transfer utility functions and helper modules
- [x] Copy over any custom libraries or dependencies

### Phase 3: Clean Up and Optimize âœ… COMPLETED
**Objective**: Remove redundant code and optimize structure
- [x] Remove unused imports and dependencies
- [x] Clean up duplicate files
- [x] Optimize file structure and organization
- [x] Removed workspace folders causing performance issues
- [x] VS Code workspace optimization completed

### Phase 4: Framework Integration ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Objective**: Integrate agents with the new framework
- [ ] Update agent imports and module references
- [ ] Integrate agents with new API routing structure
- [ ] Test agent functionality in new environment
- [ ] Fix any breaking changes or compatibility issues
- [ ] Update configuration files and environment variables

### Phase 5: Agent Restructuring ðŸ“‹ PENDING
**Objective**: Reorganize agents according to new architecture
- [ ] Implement new agent registry system
- [ ] Update agent interfaces and contracts
- [ ] Restructure agent communication patterns
- [ ] Implement new agent orchestration logic

### Phase 6: Testing and Validation ðŸ“‹ PENDING
**Objective**: Ensure all functionality works correctly
- [ ] Unit testing for individual agents
- [ ] Integration testing for agent interactions
- [ ] End-to-end testing of complete workflows
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization

### Phase 7: Production Deployment ðŸ“‹ PENDING
**Objective**: Deploy to production environment
- [ ] Set up production environment variables
- [ ] Configure production deployment pipeline
- [ ] Deploy to production server
- [ ] Monitor and validate production performance

## Current Status
- **Active Phase**: Phase 4 - Framework Integration
- **Next Milestone**: Complete agent integration with new API structure
- **Blockers**: Need to address system architecture additions before proceeding

## Notes
- All phases are designed to maintain functionality while migrating
- Each phase includes rollback procedures if issues arise
- Regular testing and validation at each stage
- Documentation updates accompany each phase completion

## Architecture Considerations
- Maintaining backward compatibility where possible
- Implementing proper error handling and logging
- Ensuring scalability for future agent additions
- Establishing clear separation of concerns between agents
