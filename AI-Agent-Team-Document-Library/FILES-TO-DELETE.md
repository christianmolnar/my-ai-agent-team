# **FILES TO DELETE - Complete List**
**All files identified for deletion - YOU can delete these safely**

## **üóëÔ∏è EMPTY PLACEHOLDER FILES (Delete Immediately)**
These files are completely empty (0 bytes) and were created as placeholders but never populated:

```
/Users/christian/Repos/My-AI-Agent-Team/AI-Agent-Team-Document-Library/temp/PROJECT-COORDINATOR-CNS-LEARNING.md
/Users/christian/Repos/My-AI-Agent-Team/AI-Agent-Team-Document-Library/temp/MASTER-ORCHESTRATOR-CNS-LEARNING.md
/Users/christian/Repos/My-AI-Agent-Team/AI-Agent-Team-Document-Library/cns-learning/README.md
/Users/christian/Repos/My-AI-Agent-Team/AI-Agent-Team-Document-Library/cns-learning/CNS-PROJECT-COORDINATOR-LEARNINGS.md
/Users/christian/Repos/My-AI-Agent-Team/AI-Agent-Team-Document-Library/cns-learning/CNS-COMMUNICATIONS-AGENT-LEARNINGS.md
/Users/christian/Repos/My-AI-Agent-Team/AI-Agent-Team-Document-Library/implementation-guides/PERFORMANCE-METRICS-IMPLEMENTATION-STRATEGY.md
/Users/christian/Repos/My-AI-Agent-Team/AI-Agent-Team-Document-Library/standards/CNS-LEARNING-FRAMEWORK.md
/Users/christian/Repos/My-AI-Agent-Team/AI-Agent-Team-Document-Library/standards/AGENT-PERFORMANCE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM.md
```

## **üóëÔ∏è DUPLICATE FILES (Delete These Duplicates)**
These are duplicates of files that exist elsewhere - keep the originals, delete these copies:

```
/Users/christian/Repos/My-AI-Agent-Team/AI-Agent-Team-Document-Library/standards/CNS-MASTER-ORCHESTRATOR-LEARNINGS.md
/Users/christian/Repos/My-AI-Agent-Team/AI-Agent-Team-Document-Library/standards/CNS-TEST-EXPERT-LEARNINGS.md
```

## **üóëÔ∏è OBSOLETE FILES (Delete - Superseded by New Architecture)**
These files are now obsolete because they've been replaced by comprehensive new architecture:

```
/Users/christian/Repos/My-AI-Agent-Team/AI-Agent-Team-Document-Library/system-architecture/GitHub-Copilot-CNS-Setup-Plan.md
```
**Reason:** This old planning document has been completely superseded by the new comprehensive CNS-ARCHITECTURE.md. The text-based diagram is messed up and the content is outdated.

## **ÔøΩÔøΩÔ∏è MIGRATION PLAN CONSOLIDATION**
Consider deleting the older migration plan (keep the clean version):

```
/Users/christian/Repos/My-AI-Agent-Team/AI-Agent-Team-Document-Library/migration-plans/AGENT-TEAM-MIGRATION-PLAN.md
```
**Reason:** This is the older 34KB version. Keep AI-AGENT-TEAM-MIGRATION-PLAN-CLEAN.md instead.

---
