# Agent Operational Requirements & Standards
*Core operational specifications for all AI agents*

> **Integration Note**: These operational requirements are fully integrated into the [Agent Team Structure Definition](../system-architecture/AGENT-TEAM-STRUCTURE-DEFINITION.md) and [Migration Plan](../migration-plans/AGENT-TEAM-MIGRATION-PLAN.md). This document provides detailed implementation standards for the requirements specified in those master documents.

## üéØ **Master Requirements**

### **Universal Agent Standards**
All agents must operate under these foundational requirements:

1. **Human-First Approval Process**
   - **First deliverable** must be an understandable, brief but complete execution plan
   - Plan must be **revised based on human feedback** and **approved by human** before proceeding
   - No autonomous execution without explicit human approval of the plan

2. **Central Neural System (CNS) Integration**
   - All agents must maintain continuous learning and improvement
   - Self-reflection and optimization must be ongoing
   - Learning must be shared across the agent ecosystem

3. **Project Coordination Integration**
   - All meaningful interactions must be logged for human review
   - Real-time and post-completion reporting required
   - Cross-agent collaboration must be documented and optimized

## üé≠ **Core Management Agent Requirements**

### **MASTER ORCHESTRATOR Operational Requirements**

**Primary Responsibility**: Central coordination and strategic oversight

**Required Operations**:
1. **Project Analysis & Team Evaluation**
   - Evaluate whether all tasks and roles can be played by the current team
   - If new agent capabilities are needed, **propose to human before project start** and any time during execution
   - If whole new agent types are needed, **propose to human before proceeding**

2. **Strategic Plan Creation**
   - Create comprehensive execution plan as **first deliverable to human**
   - Plan must include: agent roles, success criteria, timeline, dependencies
   - **Require human approval** before proceeding with any execution
   - Revise plan based on human feedback until approved

3. **Continuous Learning Requirements**
   - Monitor all agent interactions and performance
   - Identify optimization opportunities across the entire team
   - Update CNS with successful coordination patterns
   - Report team capability gaps to human

### **PROJECT COORDINATOR Operational Requirements**

**Primary Responsibility**: Detailed project management and documentation

**Required Operations**:
1. **Comprehensive Documentation System**
   - Request and compile from all agents a **complete running record** of all meaningful interactions
   - Maintain real-time availability for human review during project execution
   - Provide complete interaction log after project completion
   - **Database Integration**: Implement schema-less database for effective interaction management (markdown insufficient)

2. **Agent Coordination Management**
   - Coordinate detailed agent interactions with specific input/output deliverables
   - Maintain timeline and milestone tracking
   - Ensure quality assurance across all agent outputs
   - Facilitate multi-agent review cycles

3. **Human Communication Strategy**
   - Provide regular progress updates to human
   - Escalate issues and decisions requiring human input
   - Maintain clear communication channels with all stakeholders

## ü§ñ **Universal Agent Self-Reflection Requirements**

### **Mandatory Self-Assessment Protocol**
**Every agent must continuously review interactions and task execution, asking:**

#### **1. Success Analysis**
- **What has gone right?** 
- **Update CNS** to ensure consistent successful behaviors
- Document successful patterns for team-wide learning

#### **2. Failure Analysis** 
- **What did I do wrong?**
- **Update CNS** to prevent recurring mistakes
- Implement corrective measures immediately

#### **3. Feedback Integration**
- **What feedback have I received from other agents?**
- **Update CNS** to incorporate valuable feedback
- Acknowledge and act on constructive criticism

#### **4. Capability Gap Identification**
- **What new capabilities do I need?**
- **Communicate to Project Coordinator** for human reporting
- Identify skill development opportunities

#### **5. Role Evolution Assessment**
- **What other roles could I/do I need to play?**
- **Communicate to Project Coordinator** for human reporting  
- Suggest role expansions or modifications

#### **6. Process Optimization**
- **What should I stop doing?**
- **Communicate to Project Coordinator** for human reporting
- Eliminate inefficient or counterproductive behaviors

### **CNS Update Protocol**
```typescript
interface CNSUpdateProtocol {
  frequency: 'after_each_task_completion';
  required_elements: [
    'success_patterns',      // What worked well
    'failure_patterns',      // What needs improvement  
    'feedback_integration',  // How to apply feedback
    'capability_gaps',       // Skills needing development
    'role_evolution',        // Role expansion opportunities
    'process_optimization'   // Efficiency improvements
  ];
  communication_channels: [
    'project_coordinator',   // For human reporting
    'cns_system',           // For system-wide learning
    'agent_collaboration'   // For peer learning
  ];
}
```

## üóÑÔ∏è **Data Management Requirements**

### **Interaction Logging System**
**Infrastructure Requirements:**
- **Schema-less database** for flexible interaction storage
- **Real-time access** for human monitoring during projects
- **Comprehensive search** and filtering capabilities
- **Export functionality** for post-project analysis

### **Database Schema Design**
```sql
-- Agent interactions table (schema-less approach)
CREATE TABLE agent_interactions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  project_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  agent_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  interaction_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  interaction_data JSONB NOT NULL,        -- Flexible schema-less storage
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  human_reviewed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  cns_updated BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

-- CNS learning updates
CREATE TABLE cns_updates (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  agent_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  update_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,      -- success, failure, feedback, etc.
  update_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  applied_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  effectiveness_score DECIMAL(3,2)
);

-- Project execution plans  
CREATE TABLE execution_plans (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  project_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  plan_version INTEGER NOT NULL,
  plan_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  human_approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  approval_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  execution_started BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

## üîÑ **Implementation Integration**

### **Integration with Existing Documentation**
This document works in concert with:

1. **[AGENT-TEAM-STRUCTURE-DEFINITION.md](../system-architecture/AGENT-TEAM-STRUCTURE-DEFINITION.md)**: Defines agent roles and capabilities
2. **[AGENT-TEAM-MIGRATION-PLAN.md](../migration-plans/AGENT-TEAM-MIGRATION-PLAN.md)**: Implementation timeline and status
3. **[Multi-Agent-Research-System.md](../system-architecture/Multi-Agent-Research-System.md)**: Technical coordination architecture

### **Master Orchestrator Implementation Readiness**
When transitioning from human-driven to AI-driven orchestration:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - All operational requirements documented and tested
   - CNS system fully operational
   - Database infrastructure implemented
   - Human approval workflows established

2. **Transition Protocol**:
   - Master Orchestrator must demonstrate competency in human-supervised mode
   - All safety protocols and human override capabilities must be operational
   - Comprehensive testing of agent coordination capabilities required

3. **Success Criteria**:
   - 95%+ successful project completion rate
   - Human satisfaction with planning and execution quality
   - Effective agent coordination with minimal conflicts
   - Robust learning and improvement demonstrated

- [ ] Human approval required for all execution plans
- [ ] CNS updates occurring after each task
- [ ] Project Coordinator receiving all required interaction logs
- [ ] Database storing all interactions for human review
- [ ] Self-reflection protocols being followed by all agents
- [ ] Capability gaps being communicated to human via Project Coordinator

### **Performance Monitoring**
- **Plan Quality**: Human approval rate and revision cycles
- **Execution Effectiveness**: Task completion rate and quality scores
- **Learning Integration**: CNS update frequency and effectiveness
- **Coordination Efficiency**: Inter-agent collaboration success rate

This operational requirements framework ensures all agents operate with proper human oversight, continuous learning, and effective coordination while building toward autonomous AI-driven orchestration.
