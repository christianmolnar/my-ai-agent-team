### 2. Agent Integration Updates
- ✅ **PersonalAssistantAgent**: Fully migrated from mock implementation to Claude SDK
  - Claude Sonnet 3.5 integration
  - Persona-aware system prompts
  - Intent analysis with Claude
  - Direct response generation
  - Orchestrated response compilation
- ✅ **MasterOrchestratorAgent**: Complete Claude integration
  - Claude Opus 3 for advanced orchestration
  - Execution plan generation
  - Task decomposition and agent coordination
  - Structured response parsing

### 3. Verification & Testing
- ✅ Integration verification script passes all checks
- ✅ Configuration validation working correctly
- ✅ All 12 agent client types supported
- ✅ Error handling and graceful fallbacks implemented
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Set up API Keys**: Add Anthropic API keys to `.env.local`
2. **Test Real API Calls**: Verify integration with actual Anthropic API
3. **Update Remaining Agents**: Apply Claude integration pattern to other agents

### Phase 2: Feature Enhancement (Week 2-3)
4. **Tool Use Integration**: Add function calling capabilities
5. **Streaming Implementation**: Real-time response streaming
6. **Vision Capabilities**: Image analysis for relevant agents

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (Week 4)
7. **Performance Optimization**: Rate limiting, caching, retry logic
8. **Monitoring**: Usage tracking and error monitoring
9. **Security Hardening**: API key rotation, access controls

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Personal Assistant Agent
```typescript
const agent = new PersonalAssistantAgent();
const response = await agent.handleTask({
  type: 'conversation',
  payload: {
    message: 'Help me plan my next project',
    context: conversationHistory
  }
});
```

### Master Orchestrator Agent
```typescript
const orchestrator = new MasterOrchestratorAgent();
const plan = await orchestrator.handleTask({
  type: 'plan',
  payload: {
    request: 'Build a full-stack web application',
    requiredAgents: ['full-stack-developer', 'devops-engineer', 'qa-engineer'],
    deliverables: ['architecture', 'implementation', 'deployment']
  }
});
```
