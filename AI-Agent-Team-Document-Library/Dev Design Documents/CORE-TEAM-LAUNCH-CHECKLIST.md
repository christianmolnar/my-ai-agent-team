# Core Team Launch Checklist

## 🎯 Purpose
Track the readiness and launch status of the core agent team for live, real-time collaboration and orchestration.

## 🏁 Phase 1: Minimum Viable Team (MVT)

**Goal:** Get the following agents live and able to interact via real endpoints, CNS, and methodology files:
- Personal Assistant (already live)
- Master Orchestrator
- Project Coordinator
- Communications Agent
- Researcher Agent
- Music Coach

|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| Personal Assistant   | Yes          | Yes             | Yes         | ✅               | Live, learning, UI connected |
| Master Orchestrator  | Yes          | Partial         | No          | ⬜               | Needs endpoint, logic        |
| Project Coordinator  | Yes          | Partial         | No          | ⬜               | Needs endpoint, logic        |
| Communications       | Yes          | Partial         | No          | ⬜               | Needs endpoint, logic        |
| Researcher           | Yes          | Partial         | No          | ⬜               | Needs endpoint, logic        |
| Music Coach          | Yes          | Partial         | No          | ⬜               | Needs endpoint, logic        |

## 🚦 Phase 2: Team Integration & Collaboration

**Goal:** Enable real agent-to-agent queries, collaboration, and orchestration.

- [ ] Implement API endpoints for all core agents
- [ ] Register all agents in the GlobalAgentRegistry
- [ ] Enable CNS/methodology file access for each agent
- [ ] Test agent-to-agent capability queries
- [ ] Test agent collaboration requests (e.g., PA → Researcher)
- [ ] Enable orchestration handoff (PA → Master Orchestrator)
- [ ] Enable project timeline/resource handoff (PA → Project Coordinator)

---

## 🚀 Phase 3: Advanced Teamwork & Learning

**Goal:** Full cross-agent learning, capability enhancement, and dynamic team allocation.

- [ ] Enable agents to propose enhancements to each other
- [ ] Implement real-time capability gap analysis
- [ ] Enable cross-agent learning and knowledge sharing
- [ ] Add administrative logging and self-reflection for all agents
- [ ] Enable dynamic task allocation and optimal collaboration pathing

## 📅 Progress Log

- **2025-09-05:** Checklist created. Personal Assistant live and learning. All other core agents have code and CNS stubs but are not yet live.

---

## 📌 Next Steps

1. Implement API endpoints for Master Orchestrator, Project Coordinator, Communications, Researcher, and Music Coach.
2. Ensure each agent has a CNS and methodology file.
3. Register all agents in the GlobalAgentRegistry.
4. Test agent-to-agent queries and orchestration handoff.
5. Update this checklist as agents go live.
