## ⚠️ BOTTOM LINE

**Observatory**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ BEST analyzed (1.67 acres, dark skies, NO HOA, total freedom)  
**Affordability**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ MOST affordable ($5,525/mo = $1,475 under budget)  
**Value**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ BEST $/sqft ($331 = lowest price per square foot)  
**Location**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent (Rio Verde = remote but dark skies + Tonto Forest access)  
**Casita Potential**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ BEST (1.67 acres + NO HOA + payment cushion = easy to add)  

**Final Verdict**: This is a TOP-3 property overall. Best observatory potential, most affordable, largest lot, and plenty of room/budget to add casita. The $1,475/mo payment cushion can fund casita construction loan. With NO HOA restrictions and 1.67 acres, you have complete freedom to build both observatory and guest house. Fresh 22-day listing means seller will negotiate.  
**Casita**: ❌ NO - **DEAL-BREAKER**  

**Final Verdict**: This property represents the best value and observatory potential but fails the critical casita requirement. Must pass despite incredible strengths.

**Alternative Consideration**: Could you build a casita on the 1.67 acres? (Would need architect/contractor quotes, but likely $150K+ additional investment)
