## ⚠️ POTENTIAL CONCERNS

### Higher Monthly Payment
- $6,759/mo (just under $7K limit)
- $1,900/mo more than Jacaranda ($4,857)
- $1,700/mo more than Fountain Hills ($5,064)
- Trade-off for best upgrades + largest casita

### 3-Car Garage (Need 4)
- **Ask**: Can RV be parked on 1.06 acres?
- **Note**: Already has 50-amp RV hookup
- **Solution**: May not need 4-car if RV/cars park on lot

### No Vibrant Downtown
- **North Scottsdale location** = quieter
- 25 min to Old Town Scottsdale
- Trade-off for acreage and privacy

---

## 💡 OFFER STRATEGY

### Listing Details:
- **Days on Market**: Not listed (appears new/recent)
- **Price History**: Unknown
- **Seller Motivation**: Unknown - investigate

### Suggested Approach:

**Property IS Affordable - Negotiate for Value**
- Fully within $696K budget, monthly under $7K limit
- Negotiate to maximize value, not necessity

**Scenario 1: Aggressive (Test Motivation)**
- Offer: $1,425,000 (saves $50K = 3.4% off)
- Reduces mortgage to $744K → Monthly: $6,423
- Reasoning: "Recent upgrades great, but want room in budget"
- Net to seller: ~$1,340K after commission

**Scenario 2: Moderate (Most Likely)**
- Offer: $1,450,000 (saves $25K = 1.7% off)
- Reduces mortgage to $769K → Monthly: $6,589
- Shows seriousness while seeking value
- Net to seller: ~$1,365K after commission

**Scenario 3: As-Listed (If Must Have)**
- Offer: $1,475,000 (full price)
- Ask seller to credit $10K toward closing/upgrades
- Fast close, strong position
- Monthly: $6,759

**My Recommendation**: Start at $1,450,000
- Property already affordable, seeking optimal value
- 1.7% discount reasonable for any market
- Saves $25K → Reduces monthly by ~$170
- Room to go to $1,460-1,470K if needed
