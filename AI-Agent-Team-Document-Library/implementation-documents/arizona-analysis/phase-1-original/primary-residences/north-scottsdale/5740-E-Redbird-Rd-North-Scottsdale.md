## ⚠️ Critical Issues / Deal-Breakers

### ⚠️ **ONLY 3-CAR GARAGE** (Very Minor)
- Your requirement: 4-car OR 3-car + shop
- **BUT**: Has 50-amp RV hookup already!
- **AND**: 1.06 acres = plenty of space to add shop
- **AND**: NO HOA = can build detached shop
- **Mitigation**: Problem already 80% solved
- **Impact**: Minimal with this much land

### ⚠️ **AT BUDGET NEAR-MAX** ($1.475M)
- Only $125K below your $1.6M max
- Monthly cost $9,178 is high
- **BUT**: $250K upgrades mean you're getting $1.7M+ property
- **Mitigation**: Instant equity offsets price
- **Assessment**: Worth the premium for upgrades

### ⚠️ **78 DAYS ON MARKET** (Opportunity!)
- Longer DOM = motivated seller
- **Question**: Why so long with $250K upgrades?
- Possible reasons:
  - Priced too high initially?
  - Horse property = niche market?
  - Just bad timing/marketing?
- **Opportunity**: Strong negotiating position!

### ❓ **HORSE PROPERTY** (Verify Requirements)
- Zoned for horses but is it required?
- Are there maintenance obligations?
- Does it limit future buyers if you don't have horses?
- **Action**: Clarify with agent
