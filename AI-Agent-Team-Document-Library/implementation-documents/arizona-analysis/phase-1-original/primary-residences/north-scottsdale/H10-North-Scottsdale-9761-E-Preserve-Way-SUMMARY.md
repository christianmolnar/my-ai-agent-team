**ACTION**: Schedule showing AND plan to negotiate

**Target Price**: $1.4M - $1.425M (would bring monthly to $6,900-$7,000 range)

**During Showing Verify**:
1. **Preserve border** - Confirm direct trail access and privacy

3. **Casita quality** - Ensure separateness and condition justify price
4. **Garage/storage** - Look for RV parking or shop potential
5. **Upgrades** - Verify premium finishes warrant $499/sqft pricing

**NEGOTIATION STRATEGY**:
- Offer $1.4M (84 days = motivated seller)
- Point to small lot size (0.22 acres) as justification
- Emphasize monthly payment needs to be under $7K
- If seller accepts $1.4M: Monthly drops to ~$6,900 ✅
