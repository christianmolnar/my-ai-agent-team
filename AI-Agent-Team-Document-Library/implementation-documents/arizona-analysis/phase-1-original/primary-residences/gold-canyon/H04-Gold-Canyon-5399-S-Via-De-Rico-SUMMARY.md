## 🏆 FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### AFFORDABILITY VERDICT: ✅ **AFFORDABLE** - Best Space Option
Using $696K Ravensdale proceeds (covers all costs):
- Closing costs: ~$15K
- Net downpayment: $681K
- Mortgage: $818K
- **Monthly: $6,263** (under $7K comfort zone)
- **✅ FULLY AFFORDABLE**

### Property Assessment: **MUST SEE** - Best Lot for Observatory

**Why This Is THE Observatory Property:**
- **LARGEST LOT (1.28ac)** - 28% bigger than Fountain Hills, 21% bigger than Redbird
- **Best space** for observatory + RV + horses + future expansion
- **Mountain views** - Superstition Mountains backdrop (stunning)
- **NO HOA** - Total freedom to build observatory without approval
- **Can build 1,189 SF casita** - Flexibility for future
- **$241K price drop** - Seller highly motivated (148 DOM)
- **Horses allowed** - Full property utilization

**The Trade-Offs:**
- ❌ NO existing casita (would need to build ~$150K+ cost)
- ⚠️ Higher monthly: $6,263 vs $4,857 (Jacaranda) or $5,064 (Fountain Hills)
  - That's $1,200-1,400/mo more = $14,400-16,800/year
- ⚠️ 2006 build (19 years old) - inspect HVAC, roof, systems carefully
- ⚠️ Septic tank (not sewer) - must inspect condition
- ⚠️ 45+ min to Phoenix (Gold Canyon location)

**Decision Framework:**
1. **Observatory non-negotiable?** YES → This is your best option (largest lot)
2. **Can budget $6,263/mo?** YES → Fully affordable (under $7K limit)
3. **OK without casita initially?** YES → Can build later or use bonus room
4. **Love mountain views + space?** YES → Schedule showing immediately

**Aggressive Negotiation Strategy** (148 DOM = Very Motivated):
- **Offer $1,425,000** (saves $74K = 5% off)
  - Reduces closing to ~$14K, net down to $682K
  - Mortgage drops to $743K → Monthly drops to $5,824
  - Justify: No casita ($100K+ value), 148 DOM, septic vs sewer, 2006 build needs updates
- **Alternative: $1,450,000** (saves $49K = 3.3% off)
  - Monthly: $5,993 (more comfortable than $6,263)
  - Still excellent value for largest lot

**Showing Checklist (CRITICAL for 2006 Property):**
1. **Septic system** - When last pumped? Condition? Size adequate?
2. **HVAC age** - 2006 original? Replaced? Service records?
3. **Roof condition** - Age? Leaks? Expected lifespan remaining?
4. **Plumbing/electrical** - Any updates since 2006?
5. **Casita buildability** - Confirm 30% rule, setbacks, permits, costs
6. **Observatory site** - Best location on 1.28 acres? Dark sky area?
7. **Bonus room** - Can function as temporary guest space?

**Bottom Line**: **BEST LOT for observatory** (1.28ac) with mountain views and NO HOA, fully affordable at $6,263/mo (under $7K budget). No existing casita but room to build. **Aggressively negotiate $50-75K off (seller 148 DOM = desperate) to reduce monthly to $5,800-6,000 range**. If successful, this becomes THE property for your stargazing plans.

**Next**: Call Barbara Tillis Tietz (602-418-6823) - emphasize 148 DOM concerns, no casita reduces value $100K+, 2006 age requires updates. Start offer at $1,425K, willing to go to $1,450K. Schedule showing ASAP if receptive.
