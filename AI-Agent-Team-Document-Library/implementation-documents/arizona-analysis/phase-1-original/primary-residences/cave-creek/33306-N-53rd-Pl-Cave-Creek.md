## ⚠️ Critical Issues / Deal-Breakers

### ❌ **LOT SIZE TOO SMALL** (Major Issue)
- **Only 0.35 acres** vs your 0.5+ acre requirement
- **15,246 sqft** may not be enough for observatory
- **Action**: Measure usable backyard space at showing
- **Question**: Can you build observatory on 0.35 acres with HOA approval?
- **Impact**: This is your PRIMARY deal-breaker

### ⚠️ **AT BUDGET MAXIMUM**
- $1.5M = top of your $1-1.6M range
- Leaves less negotiating room
- Monthly cost $9,478 is high
- **Mitigation**: No room for major price reduction

### ❓ **ELEVATOR IN CASITA** (Verify Purpose)
- Suggests multi-story guest house OR accessibility feature
- Need to verify casita square footage
- Could be selling point or unnecessary feature
- **Question**: Is casita 2-story? What's total SF?

### ❓ **HOA RESTRICTIONS**
- $144/mo suggests some HOA oversight
- May restrict observatory construction
- Need CC&Rs to verify
- **Critical**: Get HOA rules on outbuildings/structures
