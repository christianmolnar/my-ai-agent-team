## 💡 Investment Recommendation

### ❌ **AVOID THIS INVESTMENT**

**Primary Concerns**:
1. **Negative Cash Flow**: Loses $452/month ($5,424/year)
2. **Poor Schools**: 2-4/10 ratings limit quality tenant pool
3. **Low Cap Rate**: 2.1% far below investment standards
4. **Needs Updates**: Additional capital required beyond purchase

### Alternative Strategies
- **Price Negotiation**: Would need 15-20% price reduction to approach break-even
- **Higher Rent**: Market research needed to determine if $2,700+ rent achievable
- **Buy & Hold**: Only viable if betting on significant appreciation

### Break-Even Analysis
To achieve break-even cash flow:
- Purchase price would need to be **~$380,000** (15% reduction)
- OR monthly rent would need to be **$2,850+** (19% increase)

**Bottom Line**: This property does not meet rental investment criteria. Poor schools and negative cash flow make it unsuitable for rental portfolio.
