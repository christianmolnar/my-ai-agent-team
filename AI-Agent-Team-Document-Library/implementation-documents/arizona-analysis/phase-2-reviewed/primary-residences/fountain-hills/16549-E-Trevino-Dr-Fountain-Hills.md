## ⚠️ Critical Issues / Deal-Breakers

### ⚠️ **ONLY 3-CAR GARAGE** (Minor Issue)
- Your requirement: 4-car OR 3-car + shop
- **Mitigation options**:
  - Convert part of 1.08 acres to RV/shop parking
  - Build detached shop (no HOA restrictions!)
  - Use 3rd car space for hobby/storage
- **Action**: Verify RV parking potential at showing
- **Impact**: Solvable with large lot + no HOA

### ⚠️ **99 DAYS ON MARKET** (Verify Why)
- Longer than average DOM
- Could indicate:
  - Overpriced initially?
  - Seasonal slowdown?
  - Property issue?
  - Just bad luck/wrong marketing?
- **Action**: Ask agent directly - "Why 99 days?"
- **Opportunity**: May be room for negotiation

### ⚠️ **HIGHER PRICE PER SQFT**
- $446/sqft vs $309/sqft Cave Creek property
- **Justification**:
  - 1.08 acres vs 0.35 acres (3x the land!)
  - Borders preserve (premium location)
  - No HOA (flexibility value)
  - Fountain Hills desirability
- **Assessment**: Price premium is for LAND, not house

### ❓ **CASITA SIZE UNKNOWN**
- "Spacious casita" is vague
- Need actual square footage
- **Question**: Is it 500sf? 800sf? 1,200sf?
- **Impact**: Affects overall value assessment

### Casita - CRITICAL:
