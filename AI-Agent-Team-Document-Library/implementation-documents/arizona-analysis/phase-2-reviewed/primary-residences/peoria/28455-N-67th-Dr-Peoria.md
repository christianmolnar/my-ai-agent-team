## ⚠️ Critical Issues

1. **NO CASITA MENTIONED** ❌❌❌ - DEAL-BREAKER if not present
   - Listing does NOT mention casita/guest house anywhere
   - Only mentions bonus rooms and office
   - **ACTION**: Call agent IMMEDIATELY to verify

2. **LOT SIZE TOO SMALL** - 0.28 acres (need 0.5+ for observatory)
   - Not enough space to build observatory
   - This alone could eliminate the property

3. **WRONG LOCATION** - Peoria (not a target area)
   - Sonoran Mountain Ranch is far from Cave Creek/Fountain Hills/North Scottsdale
   - Would need to compromise on location priority

4. **PRICE HISTORY CONCERNS** - Listed 10 months ago, removed, now relisted lower
   - Originally listed 10/13/2024 at $1,179,971
   - Dropped to $1,159,951, then $1,139,000, then removed 12/12/2024
   - Now relisted 12/26/2025 at $1,095,000 (-$84K total)
   - This suggests potential issues or motivated seller

## 🎯 Recommendation: **⚠️ URGENT - VERIFY CASITA FIRST**

### Current Status: **HOLD**

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**
1. ☎️ **Call listing agent RIGHT NOW** - Chuck Bills 602-882-3582
2. **Ask directly**: "Does this property have a detached casita or guest house?"
3. If YES → Schedule showing ASAP (listed today, could get offers fast)
4. If NO → Skip property entirely

### If Casita Confirmed → Potential Score: 75-78/100 ⭐ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Would Schedule IF:**
- Agent confirms detached casita exists
- You're willing to compromise on:
  - Location (Peoria instead of Cave Creek/Fountain Hills/N. Scottsdale)
  - Lot size (0.28 acres means NO observatory)

**Strengths if casita exists:**
- 4-car garage (rare!)
- Brand new listing (first showing opportunity)
- Custom builder quality
- Excellent schools
- Unique features (safe room, fire sprinklers)
- Recent price drops = negotiation leverage

**Deal-breakers remain:**
- 0.28 acres = No space for observatory
- Wrong location (not near vibrant downtowns)
- No trail access nearby

### If NO Casita → Score: 45/100 ❌ **SKIP**

---

## 🤔 Decision Framework

**Schedule showing if:**
- ✅ Agent confirms DETACHED CASITA exists
- ✅ You're OK sacrificing observatory dream (lot too small)
- ✅ You're OK with Peoria location (30+ miles from targets)
- ✅ 4-car garage is HUGE priority for you
- ✅ You want first crack at brand new listing

**Skip if:**
- ❌ No casita (non-negotiable)
- ❌ 0.5+ acre lot is required for observatory
- ❌ Must be in Cave Creek/Fountain Hills/North Scottsdale
- ❌ Need vibrant downtown walkability
- ❌ Need nearby trail access

---

## 📝 Notes for Showing

**Questions to Ask Agent:**
1. **"Is there a DETACHED casita or guest house? Please describe it."**
2. "Why was it removed from market 12/12 and relisted today?"
3. "Any issues with the home that caused price drops?"
4. "Is the lot size adequate for building additional structures?"
5. "Any disclosure issues we should know about?"
6. "How flexible is the seller on price given the $85K in reductions?"

**What to Look For:**
- Verify casita existence and condition
- Check actual lot size and buildable space
- Inspect the "secret safe room" (unique feature)
- Test garage space with your vehicles
- Evaluate distance to hiking trails
- Assess neighborhood vibe (gated community feel)

---

**BOTTOM LINE**: **CALL AGENT IMMEDIATELY TO VERIFY CASITA**. If no casita, skip entirely. If casita exists, this could be interesting despite wrong location and small lot - especially with the 4-car garage and brand new listing status giving you first shot.
