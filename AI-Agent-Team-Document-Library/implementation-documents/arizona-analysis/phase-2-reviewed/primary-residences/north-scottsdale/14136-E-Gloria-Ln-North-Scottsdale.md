## ⚠️ Critical Issues / Deal-Breakers

### ❌ **NO CASITA** (ABSOLUTE DEAL-BREAKER)
- Your casita requirement is **NON-NEGOTIABLE**
- Would need to build from scratch
- **Cost to build casita**: $150K-250K (800-1,200 SF)
- **Timeline**: 6-12 months construction
- **All-in cost**: $1.185M + $200K casita = $1.385M (still good value)
- **Impact**: If you can't buy without casita, SKIP entirely

### ⚠️ **RIO VERDE FOOTHILLS = VERY REMOTE**
- **40+ miles from Scottsdale** amenities
- NO walkable downtown (your #1 priority)
- Rural/isolated feel
- Nearest restaurants/shops 15-20 min drive
- **Impact**: Lifestyle mismatch with "vibrant downtown" requirement

### ⚠️ **WELL + SEPTIC** (Assume)
- Rio Verde = likely well water + septic
- Requires maintenance and monitoring
- Some buyers fear well/septic
- **Action**: Verify condition before offer

### ⚠️ **ONLY 22 DOM** (Limited Negotiating Power)
- Fresh listing = seller not desperate
- May not be flexible on price
- Need to act fast if interested

- **Total Investment**: $1.185M + $200K casita = $1.385M
- **Still under budget** by $215K
- **Best observatory property** in entire search
- **Action**: Get casita construction quotes before viewing
