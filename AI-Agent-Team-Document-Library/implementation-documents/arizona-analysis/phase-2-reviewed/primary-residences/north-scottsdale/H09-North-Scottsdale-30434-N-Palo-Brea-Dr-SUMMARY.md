- **Need to negotiate to ~$1.5M** - To get monthly payment under $7K
- **Lot size 0.37 acres** - Too small for backyard observatory (need 0.5+ acres)

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION

**ACTION**: Schedule showing BUT plan to negotiate aggressively

**Target Price**: $1.5M (would bring monthly to ~$7,582/mo - under $7K limit)

**During Showing Verify**:
1. **Property condition** - Justify current pricing
2. **Lot layout** - Check if observatory is even feasible (likely too small)
3. **Casita quality** - Ensure worth the premium price
4. **HOA restrictions** - Can they accommodate astronomy equipment?
5. **Seller motivation** - 98 days suggests room for negotiation

**NEGOTIATION STRATEGY**:
- Offer $1.48M - $1.50M range
- Point to 98 days on market as leverage
- Walk away if seller won't budge (monthly payment too high)
- Consider this property ONLY if significant price reduction
