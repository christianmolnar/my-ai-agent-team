2. **DOUBLE HOA** - $226/mo = $2,712/year ongoing cost (highest HOA fees)  
3. **SCHOOL RATING** - Crismon High School 3/10 rating ⚠️  
4. **RURAL LOCATION** - Walk Score 1/100, far from shopping/dining  
5. **COMMUNITY STILL DEVELOPING** - Newer subdivision, infrastructure incomplete  
6. **PRICE VOLATILITY** - 5 drops in 62 days = seller panic or market concern?

## 🎯 FINAL VERDICT

**Overall Score**: 72/100 ⭐⭐  
**Affordability**: ✅ EXCELLENT - $1,110 under budget  
**Casita**: ✅ YES - With kitchenette, private entrance  
**Observatory Potential**: ❌ NO - 0.22 acres TOO SMALL (smallest lot analyzed)  
**Recommendation**: **PASS** - Lot size eliminates for astronomy needs

### WHY PASS DESPITE LOW PAYMENT?

**Deal-Breaker**: 9,750 sq ft lot (0.22 acres) is **SMALLEST property analyzed**  
- **Too small** for 10-foot observatory dome + required setbacks  
- **No privacy** for stargazing (neighbors too close)  
- **HOA restrictions** likely prohibit large structures  
- **No dark sky** in developing gated community (light pollution)

### NEGOTIATION POTENTIAL (If reconsidering)
- **Current**: $1,047,000 (already dropped $33K)  
- **Target**: $1,000,000-$1,025,000 (psychological barrier + round number)  
- **Leverage**: 62 days on market, 5 price drops, desperate seller  
- **Realistic**: Seller likely accepts $1,025K (saves $22K more)

**AT $1,025,000**:  
- Closing Costs: $15,375  
- Net Down: $680,625  
- Mortgage: $344,375  
- **Monthly PITI**: ~$5,750/mo ✅ $1,250 UNDER budget

### DECISION SUMMARY
❌ **REJECT**: Lot size eliminates for observatory requirement  
✅ **AFFORDABILITY**: Excellent monthly payment ($1,110 under)  
✅ **CASITA**: Meets requirement with kitchenette  
❌ **LOT SIZE**: 0.22 acres = SMALLEST, NO SPACE for astronomy  
❌ **DOUBLE HOA**: $226/mo highest fees, community restrictions

**If observatory not required**: This would rank #3-4 (great value, new, casita)  
**With observatory requirement**: ELIMINATED - lot too small

**PRIORITY RANK**: ELIMINATED (lot size deal-breaker for astronomy)
