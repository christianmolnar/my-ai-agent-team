### ⚠️ Concerns

### ⛔ Deal-Breakers (If Applicable)

The mother-in-law suite meets the casita requirement, and the resort-style pool, theater room, and gated community provide luxury amenities at a competitive price.

### Critical Decision Factors
1. **Observatory requirement** - ❌ FAILS if backyard astronomy is priority (0.35 acres too small + HOA restrictions)
2. **Casita definition** - ⚠️ Attached mother-in-law suite, NOT separate guest house (clarify if acceptable)
3. **Location preference** - Queen Creek is 30-35 min from Phoenix (vs North Scottsdale/Gold Canyon closer options)

### Recommendation
**RECOMMENDED FOR VIEWING** if:
- Backyard observatory is NOT a requirement
- Attached mother-in-law suite acceptable vs separate casita
- Prefer affordability and turn-key condition over premium location

**PASS IF**:
- Backyard observatory is non-negotiable (lot too small)
- Require true detached casita (this is attached suite)
- Prefer North Scottsdale/Gold Canyon premium locations
- Want larger acreage for privacy/outdoor space

### Negotiation Strategy
- **Offer $1,025,000-$1,050,000** (4.7-2.3% below ask)
- **Leverage 57 days on market** - Seller may be motivated
- **Highlight cash strength** - 62.7% down payment = strong buyer
