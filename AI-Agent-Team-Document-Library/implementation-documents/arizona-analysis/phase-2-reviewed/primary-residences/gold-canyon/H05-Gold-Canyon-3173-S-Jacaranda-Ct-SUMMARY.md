## 🏆 FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### AFFORDABILITY VERDICT: ✅ **AFFORDABLE** - Lowest Monthly Payment
Using $696K Ravensdale proceeds (covers all costs):
- Closing costs: ~$12K
- Net downpayment: $684K
- Mortgage: $511K
- **Monthly: $4,857** (well under $7K comfort zone)
- **✅ FULLY AFFORDABLE**

### If Observatory is NON-NEGOTIABLE: **PASS**
- Lot only 0.16 acres vs 0.5 acre minimum
- Cannot accommodate backyard observatory
- Choose Redbird Rd #1 or Fountain Hills #2 instead

### If Observatory is FLEXIBLE: **STRONG BACKUP - Best Budget Option**
**Why This Property Stands Out:**
- **Newest construction (2022)** - zero maintenance, under warranty
- **Lowest monthly payment** - $4,857 (lowest of all options)
- **Unique upstairs casita** - different from typical backyard units
- **Resort lifestyle** - golf, tennis, pickleball, guarded gate
- **Move-in ready** - high-end contemporary upgrades
- **Best budget fit** - gives you most financial breathing room

**Trade-Offs:**
- ❌ Lot too small for observatory (0.16 vs 0.5 acres needed)
- ⚠️ HOA $570/mo (vs $0 on other properties)
- ⚠️ 45+ min from Phoenix (vs 30 min for Redbird)
- ⚠️ 51 DOM - investigate why sitting

**Negotiation Strategy:**
- Property already affordable, negotiate for extras
- Ask for: Appliances, pool equipment, furnishings
- Or: Negotiate $10-20K off to reduce mortgage further
- Justify: 51 DOM, HOA reduces appeal, lot size limitation

**Bottom Line**: Newest construction (2022) with LOWEST monthly payment ($4,857) and fully affordable within $696K budget. **Perfect if you're flexible on observatory and value brand-new, maintenance-free living with resort amenities.** Only drawback is lot too small for stargazing setup.

**Next Steps**: Call Michael Willemsen (480-278-3394) - ask why 51 DOM, verify recent upgrades/warranties, negotiate for extras or price reduction. Schedule showing to see if resort lifestyle appeals.
