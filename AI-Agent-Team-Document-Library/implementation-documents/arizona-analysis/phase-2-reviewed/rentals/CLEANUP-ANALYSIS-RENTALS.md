# Rentals Directory Cleanup Analysis
*Identifying outdated, duplicative, and misplaced files*

## 🗑️ **FILES RECOMMENDED FOR DELETION**

### Outdated Batch Processing Files (COMPLETED TASKS)
**Status:** Safe to remove - data extraction completed

**Files to Delete:**
```
DATA-EXTRACTION-BATCH-1.md
RENTAL-DATA-EXTRACTION-COMPLETE-R01-R12.md
analyze_remaining_properties.py
generate_all_rentals_complete.py
```

**Reason:** These were temporary workflow files for the initial data extraction process. All data has been extracted and integrated into the master guides and final property analyses.

### Individual Property Summaries (SUPERSEDED)
**Status:** Superseded by final R07-R12 analyses

**Files to Delete:**
```
Fountain-Hills-16844-E-Avenue-Of-The-Fountain-102-SUMMARY.md
Fountain-Hills-16844-E-Avenue-Of-The-Fountain-202-SUMMARY.md  
Gilbert-2994-E-Tulsa-St-SUMMARY.md
```

**Reason:** These were preliminary summaries for properties that either:
- Didn't make the final top 5 cut (R07-R12)
- Were replaced by more detailed analyses
- Are duplicative of data in master guides

### Generation Scripts (COMPLETED TASKS)
**Status:** One-time generation scripts - work completed

**Files to Delete:**
```
generate-all-complete.sh
generate-all-pdfs.sh
simple_pdf_generator.py
```

**Reason:** These were used to generate the initial rental PDFs. PDFs are now generated by the cover document script.

### HTML Export (WRONG FORMAT)
**Status:** Misplaced HTML file

**Files to Delete:**
```
RENTAL-INVESTMENT-STRATEGY.html
```

**Reason:** HTML export file that should not be in the rentals directory. Strategy content is covered in the master guides.
