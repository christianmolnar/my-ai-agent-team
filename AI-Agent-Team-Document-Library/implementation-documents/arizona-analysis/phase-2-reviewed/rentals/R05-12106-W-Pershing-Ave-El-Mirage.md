## 💡 Investment Recommendation

### ❌ **AVOID - DOES NOT MEET CRITERIA**

**Primary Issues**:
1. **Significant Negative Cash Flow**: Loses $207/month
2. **Low Cap Rate**: 1.6% far below investment standards
3. **Age Concerns**: 24-year-old property approaching major repairs
4. **Market Risk**: Emerging area with uncertain rental demand

**Limited Positives**:
1. **Lower Purchase Price**: $370K entry point
2. **Growth Potential**: El Mirage is developing
3. **Larger Lot**: 6,293 sqft provides space

### Required Improvements for Viability
- **30% Rent Increase**: Need $2,850/month (unlikely in El Mirage)
- **20% Price Reduction**: Need $296K purchase price
- **Market Development**: Wait for area appreciation

### Alternative Strategy
**Buy & Hold Speculation**: Only consider if:
- Betting on significant El Mirage development
- Can absorb $207/month losses for 3-5 years
- Believe area will appreciate 5-7% annually

**Bottom Line**: This property does not meet rental investment criteria. Significant negative cash flow and emerging market risks make it unsuitable for income-focused investors.
