## ðŸ¤– **Multi-AI Model Framework**

### **Universal Model Access**
- **All agents have API keys** to all available AI models
- **Complete model roster access** for maximum capability and flexibility
- **No model restrictions** - each agent can access any available model as needed

### **Available Models (Ever-Expanding)**
- **OpenAI GPT Series** (GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5, etc.)
- **Anthropic Claude Series** (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Haiku, etc.)
- **Google Gemini Series** (Gemini Ultra, Gemini Pro, Gemini Nano, etc.)
- **Meta Llama Series** (Llama 3.1, Llama 2, Code Llama, etc.)
- **Microsoft Azure OpenAI** (Azure-hosted models)
- **Mistral AI Models** (Mixtral, Mistral Large, etc.)
- **Specialized Models** (Coding-specific, Domain-specific, etc.)
- **Future Models** - Framework automatically incorporates new models as they become available

### **Intelligent Model Selection Protocol**

#### **Continuous Model Analysis**
Each agent must:
- **Study and analyze each model's capabilities** in their specialty domain
- **Maintain competency assessments** for each model across different task types
- **Track performance metrics** and effectiveness data for each model
- **Update model evaluations** as new versions and models become available
- **Document model strengths/weaknesses** specific to their domain expertise

#### **Dynamic Model Selection**
For each project and task, agents must:
- **Evaluate task requirements** against model capabilities
- **Select the most effective model** based on:
  - Task complexity and type
  - Required output quality
  - Processing speed requirements
  - Cost considerations
  - Model-specific strengths for the task
- **Document model selection rationale** for future learning
- **Switch models mid-project** if analysis indicates better alternatives

#### **Collaborative Model Intelligence**
- **Share model insights** across agents for cross-domain learning
- **Collaborative model testing** for complex multi-agent projects
- **Model recommendation system** where agents suggest optimal models for specific task types
- **Performance feedback loops** to continuously improve model selection

### **Model Performance Tracking**
- **Real-time effectiveness monitoring** of model performance per task type
- **Quality metrics tracking** for different models across various domains
- **Cost-effectiveness analysis** balancing performance and resource usage
- **Agent-specific model preference profiles** based on empirical results
- **Cross-project model performance comparison** for strategic insights

---

## ðŸ”„ **Agent Collaboration Framework**

### **Review and Feedback Process**
- **The Orchestrator and Project Coordinator** will ensure each agent submits their work product to all applicable agents for review, at least for one cycle, but until all comments by other agents are addressed
- **Agents, after having taken feedback from agents and discussed pros and cons of all feedback** are empowered to make the final decision once all feedback has been given
- **We do not want a situation where agents get into endless loops** but we also do not want agent input to be taken lightly by other agents

### **Code Review Requirements**
- **Code Reviews must be performed by ALL technical agents**: from back end and front end software developers to all the test, monitoring, availability, performance, security, and privacy specialists
- **Multi-stage review process** ensuring comprehensive coverage
- **Feedback integration and conflict resolution**

## ðŸ“‹ **Migration Strategy Update**

### **Current Migration Purpose**
Bring everything useful from the old project, ensure nothing that is not needed makes it over, and stop.

### **Restructured Development Approach**
Create a **CNS-based Software Development team** (minimal core team) to develop the full agent roster:

#### **Minimal CNS Development Team**
1. **Product Manager Agent**
2. **Dev Designer Agent** (Development Design Documentation Creator)
3. **Experience Designer Agent** (UI Designer)
4. **Full Stack Software Developer Agent**
5. **Test Expert Agent**

#### **Human Orchestrator Role**
- **Acts as primary orchestrator** for the minimal development team
- **Guides the development** of the complete 18-agent system
- **Oversees team collaboration** and strategic direction
- **Ensures quality and cohesion** across agent development

### **Development Strategy**
The minimal CNS team will work together under human orchestration to:
- **Design and build each remaining agent**
- **Establish agent interaction protocols**
- **Create testing and validation frameworks**
- **Implement the multi-AI model framework**
- **Build the complete collaborative agent ecosystem**

### **Agents NOT Moving Over** (Have their own repositories)
- **Memorias.AI** â†’ Separate repository at `/Users/christian/Repos/Memorias.AI`
- **f.insight.AI** â†’ Separate repository at `/Users/christian/Repos/f.insight.AI Advanced`

### **Functions Being Consolidated** (Not standalone agents)
- **VinylResearcherAgent** â†’ Function within ResearcherAgent
- **story_writer** â†’ Function within CommunicationsAgent  
- **FactCheckerIntegration** â†’ Function within ResearcherAgent
- **tts.ts** â†’ Function/utility
- **whisper_transcribe.ts** â†’ Function/utility
- **RSSFeedIntegration.ts** â†’ Function/utility
