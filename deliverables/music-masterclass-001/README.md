# Deliverable Workspace (Agent-Driven, Flexible)

This folder is managed by the agent team and contains all assets, drafts, and final outputs for this deliverable. The structure is not hardcodedâ€”agents can add, remove, or restructure files and folders as needed for any deliverable type or workflow.

## Example Structure (Agents May Evolve This)
- `input.md`: User narrative, requirements, and links (agent-populated)
- `team-activity.json`: Real-time agent activity log (agent-updated)
- `drafts/`: Agent contributions, intermediate drafts, or any working files
- `assets/`: Images, audio, video, code, diagrams, or any supporting files
- `final/`: Final compiled deliverable(s) in any format (PDF, Word, etc.)
- `history/`: Previous versions, iterations, or rollback points
- `manifest.json` (optional): Agent-generated metadata about the deliverable, assets, and workflow

Agents are responsible for evolving this structure as they learn and as user needs change. Nothing is fixed or hardcoded.
