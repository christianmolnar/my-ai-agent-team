# Prompt Engineering Architecture Implementation - STATUS REPORT

## Understanding the Core Issue

You correctly identified that the agents are supposed to be **prompt engineers** that create sophisticated prompts for LLM APIs to:

1. **Research Phase**: Generate prompts that help LLMs find and learn from real sources about the requested topic
2. **Creation Phase**: Based on that learning, formulate prompts to create the actual deliverable in the requested format

**The Problem**: Instead of being prompt engineers, the agents were directly generating fabricated content with placeholders like "[insert here]" and fake references.

## What I've Implemented

### 1. ✅ Research Agent Transformation

**File**: `agents/researcher.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced `generateResearchPaper()` method with prompt engineering approach
- Added `createResearchPrompts()` method that generates prompts for LLMs to discover real sources
- Added `createContentGenerationPrompts()` method that creates prompts for content creation based on research
- Added fallback methods for prompt generation

**New Flow**:
```
User Request → Research Agent → Creates Research Prompts → Creates Content Prompts → Saves Methodology
```

**Example Output**:
```
**Research Prompt 1: Official Documentation Discovery**
"Find and summarize the official Atlassian Rovo documentation from Atlassian's website. Include: product overview, key features, setup guides, and any official tutorial links. Verify information is from atlassian.com domain."

**Content Generation Prompt 1: Comprehensive Summary Creation**
"Using only the factual information discovered through research, create a comprehensive learning summary about Atlassian Rovo. Format for MS Word using Aptos font. Do NOT fabricate any information or links."
```

### 2. ✅ Communications Agent Enhancement

**File**: `agents/communications.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced direct content generation with prompt engineering approach
- Added `createDocumentFormattingPrompts()` for MS Word/Aptos font requirements
- Added `createCommunicationPrompts()` for general communication tasks
- Added detection for document creation requests

**New Flow**:
```
User Request → Communications Agent → Creates Structure/Format/Content Prompts → Saves Methodology
```

## What Still Needs Implementation

### 3. ⚠️ Agent Execution Path Integration

**Issue**: The changes I made affect specific methods, but agents are being called through the orchestration path via `executeCommunicationTask()` and similar methods.

**Required Changes**:
1. Update `executeCommunicationTask()` in communications agent to use prompt engineering approach
2. Update `conductResearch()` in researcher agent to use prompt engineering approach  
3. Ensure all orchestration paths lead to prompt generation, not content generation

### 4. ⚠️ Master Orchestrator Awareness

**Issue**: The Master Orchestrator needs to understand that agents now produce **prompts**, not **final content**.

**Required Changes**:
1. Update orchestrator to expect and handle prompt-based outputs
2. Modify result integration to present prompts clearly to users
3. Update orchestrator prompts to request "prompt engineering" instead of "content creation"

### 5. ⚠️ File Manager Integration

**Issue**: The current file manager is saving prompts as if they were final deliverables.

**Required Changes**:
1. Update file naming to indicate these are "methodology files" or "prompt files"
2. Add clear instructions in saved files about how to use the prompts
3. Consider creating separate directories for prompts vs. final outputs

## Testing Results

**Current State**: 
- ✅ Personal Assistant conversation improvements working
- ✅ Session continuity fixed
- ✅ Orchestration triggering working
- ⚠️ Agents still producing content instead of prompts (due to execution path issue)

**What Happened in Your Test**:
The system produced the fabricated research paper because:
1. The orchestration called `executeCommunicationTask()` which hasn't been updated yet
2. The agents followed the old content-generation path
3. The new prompt engineering methods weren't triggered

## Next Steps to Complete Implementation

### Phase 1: Update Agent Execution Paths
```typescript
// In researcher.ts
private async conductResearch(userRequest: string, payload: any): Promise<string> {
  // Route to prompt engineering instead of content generation
  return await this.createResearchAndContentPrompts(userRequest, payload);
}

// In communications.ts  
private async executeCommunicationTask(payload: any): Promise<string> {
  // Route to prompt engineering instead of content generation
  return await this.createAllCommunicationPrompts(payload);
}
```

### Phase 2: Update Master Orchestrator
```typescript
// Update orchestrator prompts to request prompt engineering
const systemPrompt = `Your agents are prompt engineers. They should create sophisticated prompts that help LLMs:
1. Research real sources and factual information
2. Generate accurate content based on that research
Request prompt engineering outputs, not final content.`;
```

### Phase 3: Update Response Integration
```typescript
// In personal-assistant.ts craftFinalUserResponse()
// Detect when results are prompts and present them appropriately
if (isPromptEngineering(results)) {
  return formatPromptEngineringResponse(results);
}
```

## Key Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Factual Accuracy**: LLMs use real sources instead of fabricating information
2. **Real Links**: Tutorial links come from actual research, not fabrication
3. **Proper Formatting**: Specific prompts ensure MS Word/Aptos font requirements are met
4. **Transparency**: Users see the methodology and can verify the research approach
5. **Flexibility**: Users can modify prompts or use different LLMs for execution

## Validation Plan

Once complete implementation is done:

1. **Test Research Phase**: Verify prompts guide LLMs to find real Atlassian Rovo sources
2. **Test Creation Phase**: Verify content prompts produce properly formatted deliverables
3. **Test Integration**: Verify orchestrator presents prompts clearly to users
4. **Test User Experience**: Verify users understand how to use the prompt methodology

The foundation is in place - now we need to ensure all execution paths use the new prompt engineering approach instead of direct content generation.
