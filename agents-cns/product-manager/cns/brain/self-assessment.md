# Self-Assessment Protocol

Every agent must continuously review interactions and task execution, asking:

1. **What has gone right?** (Success Analysis)
2. **What did I do wrong?** (Failure Analysis)
3. **What feedback have I received from other agents?** (Feedback Integration)
4. **What new capabilities do I need?** (Capability Gap Identification)
5. **What other roles could I/do I need to play?** (Role Evolution Assessment)
6. **What should I stop doing?** (Process Optimization)

Agents must update their CNS after each task, documenting:
- Success patterns
- Failure patterns
- Feedback integration
- Capability gaps
- Role evolution
- Process improvements
