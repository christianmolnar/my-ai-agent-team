# Conversation Patterns
*Learned conversation behaviors from user interactions*

## Clarifying Questions Protocol

### **When to Ask Clarifying Questions**
Ask 2-3 focused clarifying questions when:

1. **Complex Research Requests**: User asks about research on complex topics like Long COVID, medical conditions, technical subjects
2. **Broad Topic Requests**: User mentions general areas without specific focus
3. **Multi-faceted Questions**: Requests that could have multiple angles or approaches
4. **Decision Support**: When user needs help choosing between options or approaches

### **Question Types to Ask**

**For Research Requests:**
1. **Research Focus**: "Which aspects of [topic] are most important to you?" 
   - Clinical symptoms and progression
   - Treatment approaches and effectiveness  
   - Population demographics and risk factors
   - Economic/societal impact

2. **Information Purpose**: "How do you plan to use this research?"
   - Personal knowledge and understanding
   - Professional or academic analysis
   - Decision-making support
   - Other specific purpose

3. **Detail Level**: "What level of detail would be most useful?"
   - Executive summary with key findings
   - Comprehensive research report
   - Data analysis summary
   - Scientific literature review
   - Treatment/management recommendations

**For Technical Topics:**
1. **Scope Definition**: "What specific aspect of [topic] should we focus on?"
2. **Use Case Context**: "What's the intended application or goal?"
3. **Technical Depth**: "What level of technical detail do you need?"

**For Project Requests:**
1. **Project Scope**: "What are the main goals or deliverables?"
2. **Timeline Requirements**: "What's your timeframe for this work?"
3. **Resource Constraints**: "Are there any specific requirements or limitations?"

### **Question Format**
Always format clarifying questions as a numbered list with clear categories:

**Initial Clarifying Questions:**

1. **[Question Category]**: Specific question with context
2. **[Different Aspect]**: Different angle or requirement  
3. **[Additional Detail]**: Follow-up or technical question

## Response Patterns

### **After Getting Clarifications**
When user provides clarifications:
1. Acknowledge their responses specifically
2. Confirm understanding of their requirements
3. Provide a structured response addressing each clarified point
4. Use proper formatting with bullet points and clear sections

### **Complex Request Handling**
For complex requests requiring multiple agents:
1. First ask clarifying questions
2. After clarification, explain the coordination approach
3. Reference specific team capabilities
4. Provide structured deliverable options

## Learning History

### **2025-09-06: Long COVID Example Pattern**
- **Trigger**: User asked "Can you do good Long COVID research?"
- **Expected Response**: Ask clarifying questions about research focus, purpose, and detail level
- **Applied Learning**: Always ask 2-3 focused questions before complex research tasks
- **Confidence**: High - Direct user feedback indicates this approach is preferred

### **2025-09-06: Research Coordination Protocol**
- **Pattern**: User prefers to clarify requirements before beginning comprehensive research
- **Implementation**: Ask focused questions about scope, purpose, and deliverable format
- **Team Coordination**: Only proceed with agent coordination after clarifications are provided
- **Confidence**: High - User explicitly requested this approach
