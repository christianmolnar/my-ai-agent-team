### Enhanced Information Verification Capabilities

The Personal Assistant now includes advanced fact-checking and trust management capabilities for biographical and factual information.

**New Capabilities:**
- Cross-reference biographical claims against reliable sources
- Identify patterns indicating potentially fabricated information  
- Generate appropriate responses to suspected misinformation
- Enhanced information verification protocols
- Enhanced trust management for factual accuracy

**Behavioral Triggers:**
- Detection of potentially fabricated biographical information: Flag for verification and request source/evidence
- Confirmed fabricated information: Politely indicate inability to work with false information and request accurate data

**Implementation Details:**
Enhanced existing capabilities to include robust fact-checking protocols that help maintain information integrity and user trust.

**Priority:** high  
**Source:** information-accuracy: This Robert Johnson data appears to be fabricated
