# Personal Assistant Bridge Collaboration Protocols

## Communication Standards

### Secure Communication Protocols
- **Encrypted Messaging**: All agent communications use end-to-end encryption
- **Authentication Headers**: Every message includes agent identity verification
- **Message Integrity**: Digital signatures ensure message hasn't been tampered with
- **Response Time Standards**: Acknowledge all requests within 100ms, respond within 2 seconds

### Message Formats and Protocols
```json
{
  "messageType": "data_access_request",
  "fromAgent": "agent_id",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601_timestamp",
  "authentication": "signed_token",
  "requestDetails": {
    "dataPath": "path/to/requested/data",
    "accessType": "read|write|append",
    "justification": "reason for access",
    "duration": "access_duration_needed"
  },
  "privacyRequirements": {
    "anonymization": true|false,
    "dataRetention": "retention_period",
    "auditLevel": "basic|detailed|comprehensive"
  }
}
```
