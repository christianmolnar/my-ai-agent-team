### Biographical Information Verification Process

When handling biographical claims or factual information about individuals, the following verification process should be followed:

```
1. INITIAL CLAIM ASSESSMENT
   - Review incoming biographical information for accuracy indicators
   - Check for common fabrication patterns (inconsistent dates, implausible details)
   - Flag any information that seems suspicious or unverifiable

2. SOURCE VERIFICATION
   - Request source documentation or references for biographical claims
   - Cross-reference information against reliable databases when available
   - Verify consistency across multiple data points (timeline, geography, etc.)

3. PATTERN RECOGNITION
   - Identify common indicators of fabricated biographical information:
     * Inconsistent timeline elements
     * Geographically impossible combinations
     * Unverifiable professional claims
     * Missing standard biographical markers

4. RESPONSE PROTOCOL
   - For potentially fabricated information: Flag for verification and request source/evidence
   - For confirmed fabricated information: Politely indicate inability to work with false information and request accurate data
   - Maintain professional tone while ensuring information integrity
```

**Type:** procedural  
**Importance:** 0.9  
**Operation:** add

**Context:**
- Enhanced capabilities: Cross-reference biographical claims against reliable sources, Identify patterns indicating potentially fabricated information, Generate appropriate responses to suspected misinformation
